<h2>Virginia Graeme Baker Act / Entrapment Protection</h2>
<br/>

<a class="bookmark" title="15" name="15"></a>
<br/>
<h3>15. What is the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act (VGBA)?</h3>
<p>The Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act (VGBA) is a Federal Law is intended to protect pool and spa users from the five forms of entrapment: limb entrapment, body entrapment, hair entanglement, physical entrapment and evisceration. VGBA was passed in 2009.<br/>The law has 2 major components, the first being a requirement for all public pools and spas to be equipped with entrapment prevention devices or to be constructed with built in features that protect against entrapment. This includes installation of an approved suction outlet which meets the ASME/ANSI A112.19.8 2007 or subsequent standard. The second component has to do with providing grants to States that have laws in place for both public and private pools and spas that require protection against entrapment.</p>

<a class="bookmark" title="16" name="16"></a>
<br/>
<h3>16. What types of pools and spas must comply with VGBA?</h3>
<p>All public pools and spas must comply with VGBA. A public pool or spa is defined as one that is open to the public generally, whether for a fee or free of charge; one open to members of an organization and their guests; one at a multi-unit apartment building, apartment complex, residential real estate development, or other multi-family residential area; or one at a hotel or other public accommodations facility; or one operated by the Federal Government or by a concessionaire on behalf of the Federal Government for the benefit of members of the Armed Forces and their dependents or employees of any department or agency or their dependents.</p>

<a class="bookmark" title="17" name="17"></a>
<br/>
<h3>17. What is a SVRS?</h3>
<p>A SVRS is a Suction Vacuum Release System which can either be a SVRD, suction vacuum release device, or an AVS, automatic vent system. A SVRS is capable of providing vacuum release at a suction outlet caused by a high vacuum due to a blockage of a suction outlet. </p>

<a class="bookmark" title="18" name="18"></a>
<br/>
<h3>18. Does a pool with a single main drain that is connected to a skimmer(s) need a SVRS?</h3>
<p>In Texas, any public pool or spa with a single suction outlet must have either an AVS or a SVRD and that suction outlet must be VGBA compliant.</p>

<a class="bookmark" title="19" name="19"></a>
<br/>
<h3>19. Do pools and spas constructed before October 1, 1999 have to replace single suction outlets with dual balanced outlets?</h3>
<p>No, public pools and spas with single suction outlets that were constructed before October 1, 1999 do not have to replace them with dual balanced outlets. They must be VGBA compliant suction outlets and all single suction outlets must be equipped with a SVRD or AVS.</p>

<a class="bookmark" title="20" name="20"></a>
<br/>
<h3>20. What is a VGBA approved suction outlet?</h3>
<p>A VGBA approved suction outlet is one that meets the requirements of the ASME/ANSI A112.19.8 - 2007 or successor standard. ASME/ANSI A112.19.8 - 2007, or successor standard establishes materials, testing and marking requirements for totally submerged suction outlets and fittings in swimming pools, wading pools, spas, hot tubs and other aquatic facilities.   </p>

<a class="bookmark" title="21" name="21"></a>
<br/>
<h3>21. Does VGBA just require changing the suction outlet covers?</h3>
<p>No, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, CPSC clarified its interpretation of suction outlet to include the sump and/or body, cover/grate, and hardware. This is the definition of a suction outlet as found in the ASME/ANSI A112.19.8: “<i>a fitting, fitting assembly, cover/grate, and related components that provide a localized low pressure area for the transfer of water from a swimming pool, wading pool, spa, or hot tub.” </i>This definition would include the sump.</p>

<a class="bookmark" title="22" name="22"></a>
<br/>
<h3>22. What should I do to document installation of VGBA compliant suction outlet covers in my public pool or spa?</h3>
<p>Documentation which provides information about the suction outlet covers installed should be maintained as part of a permanent record for the life of that cover. The documentation should include the model number, the name of the manufacturer, the installation date of the cover, and the lifetime in years for that cover. Engineered suction outlets should have the design engineer’s inspection report with seal.</p>

<a class="bookmark" title="23" name="23"></a>
<br/>
<h3>23. What does the recall of some suction outlet covers mean and which ones were recalled?</h3>
<p>In May of 2011 CPSC announced a voluntary recall of certain suction outlet covers. There were several manufacturers with multiple outlet models that recalled the covers. For information about the names and models of the recalled covers go to: </p>
