<td width="77%" valign="top" height="193" align="left"><p>In response to numerous advertisements promoting self-referral for CT (computed tomography) screening -- which is a type of X-ray examination -- the Texas Radiation Advisory Board in conjunction with the Bureau of Radiation Control cautioned the public about the practice of Whole Body CT Screening Examinations. The advisory informed the public that rules require that CT studies be ordered by a licensed physician and that studies should be based on an individual's medical history. Some of the problems with CT Screening cited in the advisory included the lack of any specific scientific evidence that CT screening improves medical care or prolongs life and the concern over the relatively high amount of radiation received by patients undergoing the CT screening exams.</p>
