<p>In April 1998, the State of Texas was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Division of Mammography Quality and Radiation Programs (DMQRP) as an accreditation body and joined three other approved accrediting bodies - the State of Iowa, the State of Arkansas and the American College of Radiology. </p>
<p>Mammography facilities in Texas may choose the State of Texas or the American College of Radiology as their accreditation body. Both accreditation bodies have been approved to accredit all film screen, full field digital, and CR mammography units currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Device Evaluations (ODE).</p>
<p>To provide mammography services in the Texas, a facility must be certified by DSHS, an FDA approved Certifying Agency. To receive a Certified Mammography Facility certificate, a facility must apply for and achieve accreditation through the accrediting body of their choice. </p>
