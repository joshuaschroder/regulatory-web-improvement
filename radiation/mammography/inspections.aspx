<h2>Mammography Quality Assurance</h2>
<p>Mammography system includes the x-ray machine, quality control and processing equipment, technologist and interpreting physician. Each mammography system that receives a certification, will be inspected within 60 days of receiving its certification. After the initial inspection, each certified mammography system is inspected annually.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Posting Requirements</h2>
<h3>Certificate of Inspection</h3>
<p>After a satisfactory inspection, the agency will issue a Certificate of Inspection. The certificate shall be posted in a conspicuous place on or near where the mammography system is used.</p>
<h3>Notice of Failure</h3>
<p>Any severity level I violation involving a mammography system constitutes grounds for posting a Notice of Failure of the mammography system. Severity level I violations are the most significant and may have a significant negative impact on public health and safety. Therefore, the Notice of Failure must be posted:</p>
<ul>
	<li>On the mammography x-ray unit in a conspicuous place if the violation relates to the machine; or</li>
	<li>In a place near the mammography system is operated if the violation is personnel related; and</li>
	<li>In a sufficient number of places to allow patients to observe the notice</li>
</ul>
<p>The Notice of Failure shall remain posted until the facility is authorized to remove it by Radiation Control.</p>

<h3>Patient Notifications</h3>
<p>Registrants who receive a Notice of Failure due to a severity level I violation, are required to notify the patients who had a mammography performed at the facility during the 30 days preceding the date of the inspection. The facility shall:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Inform the patient that the mammography system failed to meet the agency's certification standards;</li>
	<li>Recommend that the patient have another mammogram performed at a facility with a certified mammography system;</li>
	<li>List the 3 closest facilities to the original testing facility that have a certified mammography system;</li>
	<li>Explain the failure of the mammography system and</li>
	<li>Explain the potential consequences to the patient</li>
</ul>
