<h2>What are Annual Fees?</h2>
<p>Annual fees are required as described by <a title="25 Texas Administrative Code, ยง289.204 - Fees for Certificates of Registration" href="/radiation/mammography/laws-rules.aspx#289204">25 Texas Administrative Code, ยง289.204 - Fees for Certificates of Registration</a> for all mammography certifications and interventional radiography. These fees are used to cover all direct and indirect costs associated with licensing a company or individual.  (i.e. any future amendments within the noted billing period, costs associated with required inspections of your license/registration, standard operating costs, etc.).</p> 
<p>These required fees will be billed approximately 60 days prior to the fees being due.  These bills should be paid in a timely manner or your certification could be revoked, which can result in penalties and fines.</p>

<h3>How do Annual Fees Differ from Technical Renewal?</h3>
<p>While annual fees require payment every year, technical renewal occurs every 3 years and requires re-submission of all appropriate forms, procedures, and fees.</p>
<p>New certificates of registration are not issued for payment of annual fees.</p>
