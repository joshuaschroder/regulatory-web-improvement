<p>In 1993, the Texas Legislature passed House Bill 63 which amended the Texas Health and Safety Code requiring that Texas becomes an Accrediting Body and to apply to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), Division of Mammography Quality Radiation Program (DMQRP) to be a Certifying Agency. </p>

<p>In April 1998, the State of Texas was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an accreditation body and joined three other approved accrediting bodies - the State of Iowa, the State of Arkansas and the American College of Radiology.</p>

<p>On September 1, 2008, the State of Texas was approved as a Certifying Agency by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and carries out the certification functions for all facilities located within Texas.</p>

<p>To legally perform mammography in Texas, a facility must be certified. To obtain a certification, the facility must apply for and achieve accreditation by an FDA approved accreditation body and meet applicable requirements established by the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) and the accreditation body of choice. Mammography facilities may choose to be accredited through the Department of State Health Services (DSHS) or the American College of Radiology (ACR).</p>

<p>All facilities that perform interventional breast radiography must apply for and receive a Certificate of Mammography Systems. Machines used exclusively for interventional breast radiography are not required to be accredited by an FDA approved accrediting body.</p>

<p>Each new mammography facility will be inspected within 60 days of receiving a Certified Mammography Facility Certificate. After the initial inspection, each mammography facility will undergo an annual inspection by an FDA certified MQSA inspector.</p>
