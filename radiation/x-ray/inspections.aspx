<h2>What Do We Inspect?</h2>
<p>The Radiation Control Program inspects facilities that use X-rays units and businesses that service X-ray units.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>How Long Does an Inspection Take?</h2>
<p>A routine inspection involves a review of certain paperwork, testing some of the X-ray units, observation of use activities, and discussions of compliance and/or noncompliance issues. The time will vary based on the number of X-ray units and the type of facility.  A small dental or chiropractic office with one or two X-ray units may take about an hour or so to inspect.  A large hospital may take about 3-5 hours to inspect. Inspection times may vary based on the orderliness of recordkeeping and the overall maintenance of X-ray units.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>How Often Do We Inspect?</h2>
<p>Facilities are normally inspected by the Radiation Control Program on the below intervals.  The inspection interval for facilities using multiple types of X-ray units are determined by the types of units with the shortest inspection interval.  For example, facilities that use general purpose and fluoroscopy units would have a two year interval.  </p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> With the exception of veterinary facilities, these intervals typically do not coincide with the requirement for facilities to obtain the services of a company to perform their Equipment Performance Evaluation (EPE).</p>

<h2>How Long Does It Take to Test the X-Ray Units?</h2>
<p>It will be necessary to have a credentialed operator who normally operates the X-ray unit(s) available to operate the unit(s) during the inspection. In facilities with a large number of units, the inspector will only test a sample of the units, typically some of each type.</p>

<h2>What Records Are Reviewed and How Long Does That Take?</h2>
<p>Review of inspection documents will take additional time and will depend on the size and type of the facility.  A small dental office or chiropractor will take approximately 30 minutes.  A large hospital will take 3-4 hours.</p>
<p>15-30 minutes should be allowed for the inspector to discuss the inspection findings with the radiation safety officer at the conclusion of the inspection.</p>
<p>The inspector may ask to review the following records during the inspection:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Current Certificate of Registration</li>
	<li>The regulations applicable to your Registration</li>
	<li>Operating and Safety procedures</li>
	<li>Prior Notices of Violations and your reply to these</li>
	<li>Notice to Employees</li>
	<li>Annual evaluations of protective devices and a record of those evaluations</li>
	<li>Equipment Performance Evaluations
		<ul>
			<li>Fluoroscopic machines: annual radiation output measurement performed by a licensed medical physicist</li>
			<li>C.T. machines: annual dose measurements performed by a licensed medical physicist</li>
			<li>Radiation Therapy: surveys and calibrations performed by a licensed medical physicist</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Record of proper credentialing for operators</li>
	<li>Personnel monitoring records</li>
	<li>Dose to the public records</li>
	<li>Records of film processing equipment maintenance.</li>
	<li>QA/QC for digital imaging acquisition systems</li>
	<li>Records of receipt, transfer, and disposal of X-ray machines</li>
	<li>Annual Inventory of all X-ray machines.</li>
	<li>U.S. F.D.A. (Food &amp; Drug Administration) variances for certain X-ray machines</li>
	<li>Radiation Protocol Committee records for Fluoroscopically Guided Interventional (FGI) and/or CT.</li>
</ul>
