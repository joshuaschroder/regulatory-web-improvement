<h2>How long can a new facility operate without a certificate of registration?</h2>
<p>
	A first time customer of x-ray radiation machines is not required to have a registration in hand before a purchase of radiation machines. A facility must apply for a certificate of registration within 30 days of beginning use of the radiation machines. Companies using the following radiation machines are required to have a certificate of registration prior to use: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Industrial accelerators</li>
	<li>X-ray services and industrial radiographic (IR) operations</li>
</ul>
<p>These exceptions can be found in <a title="25 Texas Administrative Code, &#167;289.226" href="/radiation/x-ray/laws-rules.aspx#289226">25 Texas Administrative Code, &#167;289.226</a>.</p>
