<h2>What are Biennial Fees?</h2>
<p>Biennial fees must be paid every two years to keep a certificate of registration active and are required order to continue operating X-ray machines. Registrants will receive an invoice by mail approximately 60 days prior to the fees being due. Failure to submit biennial fees will result in a revocation of the certificate of registration.</p>
<p>Biennial fees are authorized by <a title="25 Texas Administrative Code, ยง289.204 - Fees for Certificates of Registration" href="/radiation/x-ray/laws-rules.aspx#289204">25 Texas Administrative Code, ยง289.204 - Fees for Certificates of Registration</a>.</p>


<h3>How do Biennial Fees Differ from Technical Renewal?</h3>
<p>While biennial fees require payment every two years, technical renewal typically occurs in 8-10 year intervals and requires re-submission of all appropriate forms, procedures, and fees.</p>
