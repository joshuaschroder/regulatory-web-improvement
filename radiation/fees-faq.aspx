<p><strong>1. Can I pay any radiation fee payments by phone? </strong></p>
<p>No, we cannot process any payments by phone.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>2. I received a BILL FOR MY RADIATION CONTROL LICENSE by mail.  Can I pay this fee with a credit card?  (This is also known as a biennial fee.) </strong></p>
<p>Certain types of registration and certification biennial fees can be paid by credit card through the <a title="Regulatory Services Online Licensing website" href="https://vo.ras.dshs.state.tx.us/">Regulatory Services Online Licensing website</a>. Examples of biennial fees that can be paid by credit card are:  R#, Z#, ZF#, ZP#, and M# certificates.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>3. What if I have a license number that is not in the above list?  Are there alternate methods of payment?  </strong></p>
<p>Only two other license types can only process ACH (electronic check) payments online.  Those license numbers will begin with G#s and L#s.  If you cannot pay online by this method, you will have to mail in a check as payment.</p>
<p>Mammography Accreditation, Reciprocity licenses/registrants, and Sealed Source and Device applications or evaluations cannot be paid online.   The Agency can only accept payments by check for these fees.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>4. Can a new applicant pay for fees by credit card?</strong></p>
<p>No.  We cannot accept payment for new application in this online system for new applications. This online system will only allow for biennial fee payments.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>5. When paying through the Online Services site, what is my Board Type?</strong></p>
<p>This selection depends on your license/registration type, in other words, your license number on your bill:</p>
<ul>
	<li>R#,Z#, ZP#, ZF# - your Board Program will be:  Machine Registration Programs</li>
	<li>M# - your Board Program will be:  Mammography Programs</li>
	<li>G#, L#- your Board Program will be:  Radioactive Material Programs</li>
</ul>

<hr/>
<p><strong>6. Why did I receive a bill when my license/registration certificate shows a different expiration date one it?  Do I still need to pay this?</strong></p>
<p>Your expiration date on your license/registration certificate is there to denote a technical expiration date.  This is a date set in the future when you will need to submit all newly updated forms and the appropriate updated procedures for RSLB to issue a renewed certificate for your radiation program, or else your license/certificate is expired.  Those license/certificates with dates on them are usually for 8 years, and even to up to 10 years into the future.  In the interim time, the fee rules state in <a title="25 TAC 289.204 " href="/radiation/laws-rules.aspx#289204">25 TAC 289.204</a>, that you will be invoiced every 2 years for the appropriate fees RSLB assess for your company.  So, yes, you need to pay these fees to keep your license in good standing with the Radiation Safety Licensing Branch (RSLB). </p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>7. I have found an error on the invoice, what should I do?</strong></p>
<p>Please contact the Radiation Safety Licensing Branch (RSLB) at (512) 834-6688 ext. 2052 and let us know of the discrepancy.  We will try to assist you as best we can, or inform you of the appropriate steps needed to get this corrected.  (Remember, if RSLB was never notified in writing with appropriate signatures that you have closed a site or removed equipment, accounting canâ€™t remove the fees right away. That requires an <a title="amendment to your license/certificate" href="/radiation/forms.aspx">amendment to your license/certificate</a>.)</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>8. I received a bill in the mail, but I closed/sold my practice/business.  What do I do now?</strong></p>
<p>Please <a title="contact the agency" href="/radiation/contact.aspx">contact the agency</a> for termination instructions. (512) 834-6688 ext. 2052.</p>
