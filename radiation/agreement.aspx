<p>On January 10, 1963, during a ceremony at the State Capitol, the State of Texas and the United States Atomic Energy Commission (now the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission) signed an agreement that gave Texas licensing and regulatory authority over radioactive materials in the state, with the exception of special nuclear material in excess of a critical mass and radioactive material utilized by federal agencies.</p>

<p>The agreement became effective March 1, 1963. The Texas Department of State Health Services, Radiation Control, has since ensured that the beneficial uses of radiation have been maximized while unnecessary exposure to radiation affecting occupational workers and Texas citizens has been minimized.</p>

<p>Forty years later, Representative Warren Chisum, R-Pampa, introduced a resolution, <a title="HRC 20" href="http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&amp;ItemID=8589991348">HRC 20</a>,  reinforcing the importance of the original agreement.</p>
