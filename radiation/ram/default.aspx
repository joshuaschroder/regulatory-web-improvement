<h2>Attention: Change in Agency Policy</h2>
<p>Due to security and accountability concerns, Radiation Control will no longer authorize radioactive material quantities as "No single source to exceed..." for sealed sources. Therefore, you will need to specify a specific number of devices you need authorization for.</p>
<p>With your next amendment request or renewal provide the following information:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Provide a list of the device model numbers you currently have in your possession</li>
	<li>Indicate a total number of devices, for each model you need authorization for</li>
</ol>
<p>We understand you need to have authorization for a sufficient number of devices to conduct routine business and this number may be more than what you actually possess.</p>
