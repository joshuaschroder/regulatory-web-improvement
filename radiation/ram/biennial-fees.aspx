<h2>What are Biennial Fees?</h2>
<p>Biennial fees are required as described by <a title="25 Texas Administrative Code, ยง289.204 - Fees for Radioactive Material Licenses" href="/radiation/ram/laws-rules.aspx#289204">25 Texas Administrative Code, ยง289.204 - Fees for Radioactive Material Licenses</a> for all radioactive materials licenses. These fees are used to cover all direct and indirect costs associated with licensing a company or individual.  (i.e. any future amendments within the noted billing period, costs associated with required inspections of your license/registration, standard operating costs, etc.).</p> 
<p>These required fees will be billed approximately 60 days prior to the fees being due.  These bills should be paid in a timely manner or your license could be revoked, which can result in penalties and fines.</p>

<h3>How do Biennial Fees Differ from Technical Renewal?</h3>
<p>While biennial fees require payment every two years, technical renewal typically occurs every 8-10 years and requires re-submission of all appropriate forms, procedures, and fees.</p>
<p>New licenses are not issued for payment of biennial fees.</p>
