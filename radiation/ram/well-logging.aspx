These situations could involve damage or rupture of a sealed source, vagrancy of a restricted area at a temporary job site by non-radiation workers, the theft of the source and/or material, the loss of a sealed source in the well bore, a vehicle accident, loss or damage to an employee's personnel monitoring device, over exposure, contamination of personnel, equipment, facilities, homes, vehicles, and ground surfaces. For all emergency procedures involving the potential for contamination, procedures should include actions to prevent the spread of contamination and minimize inhalation and ingestion of radioactive material. Include in all emergency procedures a discussion of the actions to be taken by the RSO when emergency situations occur. Formulate procedures for the notification of proper personnel in the event of an accident or well excursion. Include a listing of emergency telephone numbers of persons to be contacted in those situations.</p>
<p>In the event of an excursion or other type of reversal requiring that material be pumped out of the well bore, large quantities of material will be returned to the surface that contain radioactive material. This contaminated material must be removed from the environment or, isolated in a manner that will reduce the concentration of each radionuclide in the material below the limits established in <a title="25 TAC §289.202(eee)" href="/radiation/laws-rules.aspx#289202">25 TAC §289.202(eee)</a>.</p>
<p>If the applicant proposes to use unsealed radioactive material for subsurface operations, detailed procedures must be developed in the event of an uncontrolled release of radioactive material to the environment. In addition to the potential concerns in emergency situations, the applicant should include procedures for obtaining representative samples of the material out of the well bore, subjecting those samples to analysis at a laboratory acceptable to the Radiation Control Program, and maintain copies of all laboratory analyses for review by the Radiation Control Program. These procedures should also discuss how to restrict access to and how to post the pit area until laboratory analysis indicates that the concentration of the radioactive material has dropped below <a title="25 TAC §289.202(eee)" href="/radiation/laws-rules.aspx#289202">25 TAC §289.202(eee)</a> limits. These procedures should also indicate that the Radiation Control Program must be notified within 30 days of the excursion.
