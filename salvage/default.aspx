<h2>Food Salvage</h2>
<p>Firms that do any of the following are required to obtain a salvage license:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A firm that buys or sells distressed merchandise</li>
	<li>A firm that reconditions distressed merchandise</li>
	<li>A facility or person that engages in the reconditioning or inventorying, separating, and disposing of distressed food on a fee for service basis</li>
</ul>
<p>Distressed merchandise is any food, drug, device, or cosmetic that has been subjected to prolonged or improper storage, loss of label or identity, or abnormal environmental conditions such as extremes in temperature, humidity, smoke, water, fumes, pressure, or radiation that are due to natural disasters or otherwise, or that may have been rendered unsafe or unsuitable for human consumption or use for any other reason.</p>

<h2>Drug and Medical Device Salvage</h2>
<p>This program is responsible for answering questions from consumers regarding salvaged drugs, devices, and cosmetics and offers regulatory guidance and interpretations to drug, device, and cosmetic reconditioners and brokers. The Drugs and Medical Devices Group conducts routine inspections of drug, device, and cosmetic salvage establishments, brokers, and warehouses, as required by state law, and investigates complaints involving distressed or reconditoned drugs, devices, and cosmetics. Businesses engaged in the reconditioning and/or distribution of distressed drugs, devices, or cosmetics are required to license with the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS).</p>
