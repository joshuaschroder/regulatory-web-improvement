	<h3>What is an administrative renewal?</h3>
	<p>An administrative renewal is a fee that must be paid in order to continue operating x-ray and laser devices. The fee is required every two years. Think of an administrative renewal as what happens when you pay your two-year registration fee. For information on fee payment see <a title="25 TAC §289.204" href="/radiation/laws-rules.aspx#289204">25 TAC §289.204</a> of the rules.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<a class="bookmark" title="9" name="9"></a>
	<h3>How long will my administrative renewal period be?</h3>
	<p>Administrative renewals are good for two years.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<a class="bookmark" title="10" name="10"></a>
	<h3>Who is eligible to pay for registration administrative renewals online?</h3>
	<p>Facilities whose registration has not expired or has expired no more that 30 days ago are eligible to pay the registration administrative renewal fees online.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<a class="bookmark" title="11" name="11"></a>
	<h3>How does paying registration administrative renewal fees online work?</h3>
	<p>Paying your registration administrative renewal fee online is a simple process. The first step is to login by entering the registration number on your certificate and the first five digits of your billing address zip code. This step is necessary to verify eligibility. If you are eligible, you will be given an option to pay the registration administrative renewal fee at this time. Changes can be made to your billing address and those changes should be completed in conjunction with paying your registration administrative renewal fee. The next steps are to answer questions, review information entered, and then proceed to the payment page. After providing payment information, the final step is to view and print the transaction receipt.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<a class="bookmark" title="12" name="12"></a>
	<h3>Can I pay my registration administrative renewal fee online any time?</h3>
	<p>Yes, the system is available 7 days per week, 24 hours per day except for routine maintenance down time.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<a class="bookmark" title="13" name="13"></a>
	<h3>What is a technical renewal?</h3>
	<p>A technical renewal involves the complete resubmission of an application for your registration, including such things as: Radiation Safety Officer Qualifications and other special authorizations. Various regulatory guides are available to assist in preparing an application for technical renewal. For assistance contact the Radiation Control Licensing Branch at (512) 834-6688.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<a class="bookmark" title="14" name="14"></a>
	<h3>Can I change my address at the time of renewal?</h3>
	<p>You can ONLY change your billing address at the time of renewal. If your company’s name, Radiation Safety Officer, or facilities/locations have changed, please contact Radiation Control Registration at (512) 834-6688 for instructions.</p>

	<h2>Technical Issues</h2>
	
	<br/>
	<a class="bookmark" title="17" name="17"></a>
	<h3>Whom do I contact with technical difficulties in operating the site?</h3>
	<p>Please refer to the <a title="Online Licensing Help Center" href="http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/regulatory/online-licensing/">Online Licensing Help Center</a> to see if your question is addressed in the help topics. If your cannot find the answer to your question, see the  <a title="Contact Information" href="http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/regulatory/online-licensing/contact.aspx">Contact Information</a> page for detailed information on how to contact support.</p>

	<a class="bookmark" title="18" name="18"></a>
	<h3>Why did I receive a bill when my license/registration certificate shows a different expiration date one it?</h3>
	<p>Your expiration date on your license/registration certificate is there to denote a technical expiration date.  This is a date when you will need to submit all newly updated forms and the appropriate updated procedures for RSLB to issue a new certificate for your radiation program, or else your certificate is expired.  Those certificates with dates on them are usually for 8 years, and even to up to 10 years into the future.  In the interim time, the fee rules state in Title 25, Texas Administrative Code &#0167;289.204, that you will be invoiced every 2 years for the appropriate fees RSLB assess for your company.  So, yes, you need to pay these fees to keep your license current. </p>
	
	<br/>
	<a class="bookmark" title="19" name="19"></a>
	<h3>I have found an error on the invoice, what should I do?</h3>
	<p>Please contact the Radiation Safety Licensing Branch (RSLB) at (512) 834-6688 ext. 2052 and let us know of the discrepancy.  We will try to assist you as best we can, or inform you of the appropriate steps needed to get this corrected.  (Remember, if RSLB was never notified in writing that you closed a site, or removed equipment,  accounting can’t remove the fees right away.  That requires an amendment to your certificate.)</p>
	
	<br/>
	<a class="bookmark" title="20" name="20"></a>
	<h3>I received a bill in the mail, but I closed/sold my practice. What do I do now?</h3>
	<p>You will need to officially request a termination of your license/registration.</p>
	<p>For a RAM license you will need to <a title="submit a request to terminate" href="/radiation/ram/termination.aspx">submit a request to terminate</a> letter signed off on by the RSO, owner or upper management of the company.</p>
	<p>For X-Ray registrations, complete and submit form <a title="RC-17R, Request for Registration Termination" href="/radiation/x-ray/forms.aspx#17R">RC-17R, Request for Registration Termination </a>. If this is completed in a timely manner, these fees could be voided.</p>
	<p>For Laser registrations, complete and submit form <a title="RC 17-L, Termination of Laser Registration" href="/radiation/lasers/forms.aspx#17L">RC 17-L, Termination of Laser Registration</a>. If this is completed in a timely manner, these fees could be voided.</p>
