	<p>If you receive an error message stating: “Entity already associated with another User ID,” contact the Radiation Group for further instructions at (512) 834-6688.</p>
	<p>Once the license is added, it is attached to your email address, and it cannot be added to more than one email address at a time. To detach a license from your email address, contact Radiation Safety Licensing- Operations &amp; Records Group at (512) 834-6688.</p>
	
	<h3>Step 3 - Confirm Information</h3>
	<p>Once the system finds the license entered, a confirmation message will be displayed. If this looks correct, select “I Confirm this is my information,”  then click on the “Next” button.</p>

	<p>The attestation statement screen will appear. Click "Yes," then select the “Next” button.</p>
	
	<p>(An Application Summary email may still be sent to your account’s email address. This email will show the license number, billing address and amount due. This is similar to an invoice, but nothing has been paid yet.)</p>
	
	<p>On the Fee Summary Report, the total amount due is listed. Click on the “Pay Now” button.</p>
	
	<p>On the Online Application Payment screen, make sure the application is checked off next to the fee dollar amount (Right side of the screen.)  Select your payment type (ACH or credit card), then click the “Next” button.</p>
	
	<p>Verify the payment data on the Confirm Payment Details screen, and click the "Next" button.</p>
	
	<p>Fill in the payment detail on the Customer Billing Information page and click "Continue" to submit payment. A receipt is available for completed payments.</p>
