<p>The Abusable Volatile Chemicals Program provides for licensure, inspection, outreach and education, and enforcement of rules and statutes pertaining to restriction of minors from purchasing inhalant-abuse products and to proper signage for retail establishments that sell abusable volatile chemicals. The Abusable Volatile Chemical Program operates through fees generated from permitting of retail facilities that sell regulated products.</p>
