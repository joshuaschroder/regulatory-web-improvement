<h2>5. My facility is a new retail sales business that is owned by a parent company that already has AVC Permits for its other facilities. Can I use Texas.gov to apply for the new facility’s AVC Permit?</h2>

<a class="bookmark" title="6. If I use Texas.gov to apply for a new facility under a parent company, can the parent company pay the filing fee?" name="6"></a>
<h2>6. If I use Texas.gov to apply for a new facility under a parent company, can the parent company pay the filing fee?</h2>
<p>The Texas.gov system will allow you to pay the filing fee for a new facility under a parent company as long as the parent company is willing to provide credit or debit card information or electronic check payment information to complete the online application process. Please note that the two-year fee payment of $59.00 will have to be paid through Texas.gov, regardless of the expiration date on the permit. The parent company will receive a fee credit of any overpayment (based on the common permit expiration date for all of the parent company’s AVC Permit facilities) for the new AVC Permit facility that can then be applied to future AVC Permits obtained by the parent company.</p>

<a class="bookmark" title="7. When I apply for an AVC Permit through Texas.gov, when will this permit expire?" name="7"></a>
<h2>7. When I apply for an AVC Permit through Texas.gov, when will this permit expire?</h2>
<p>All AVC Permits issued by the agency are now <strong>two-year permits</strong>, with <em>one exception</em>: New facilities that are added under a parent company that has other AVC-permitted facilities will be given the same expiration date as the parent company’s other facilities. In other words, all AVC-permitted facilities owned by that parent company will have a common expiration date, so the new facility may be issued a permit that expires in less than two years. </p>

<h2>8. Is there any additional fee charge that applies to using Texas.gov?</h2>
<p>Yes, the Texas Department of State Health Services has been authorized by the Texas Legislature and the Texas Online Authority to charge an additional fee to recover costs associated with development and maintenance of the Texas Online services. There is an additional fee of $4.00 per permit that will be added to the two-year AVC Permit fee of $55.00. Therefore, the total permit fee will be $59.00. This fee applies to all AVC permit holders, including parent companies, whether or not you choose to apply for a new or renewal permit online.</p>

<p>You may still apply for a new or renewal AVC Permit by submitting the appropriate completed AVC Permit application form (new or renewal) and a fee payment of $59.00. Businesses that are renewing their AVC Permits will pay the permit fee of $59.00 by submitting their check or money order for the fee along with the payment coupon that the agency mailed to them with their renewal notice. The permit fee of $59.00 applies to all, whether or not you choose to apply for your permit online.</p>
