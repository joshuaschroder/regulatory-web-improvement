<h2>Who Must be Certified?</h2>
<p>Under Chapter 486 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, any business establishment (other than a pharmacy licensed by the Board of Pharmacy) that wishes to engage in over-the-counter sales of products containing any quantity of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or norpseudoephedrine must have a Certificate of Authority (COA) from DSHS.</p> 


<hr/>
<h2>Applying for Certification</h2>
<p>In order to obtain a COA, a business must: <a title="file an application" href="/pseudoephedrine-retail/forms.aspx">file an application</a> with DSHS; pay the required fee ($600 for two years); and agree to comply with the restrictions to access and record keeping requirements of these sections. Compliance with these sections will be verified through audits and inspections. </p>
