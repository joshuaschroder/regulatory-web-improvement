<p>On November 8, 2011, the Drugs and Medical Devices Group notified firms that hold Certificates of Authority (COA) of changes in the law as a result of implementation of House Bill 1137, 82nd Texas Legislature, pertaining to over-the-counter sales of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and norpseudoephedrine (PSE). These changes include establishment of a real-time tracking system to prevent illegal sales of PSE products as well as new limits on the quantity of PSE products sold.</p>
