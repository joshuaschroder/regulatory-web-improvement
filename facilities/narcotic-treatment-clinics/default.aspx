<h2>About Narcotic Treatment Clinics (NTCs)</h2>
<p>Narcotic Treatment Clinics (NTCs) are specialized medical clinics that treat patients addicted to heroin or other opiates. Patients are prescribed maintenance or medically supervised withdrawal doses of methadone or buprenorphine. Confidentiality of patient identity is protected by Federal law.  NTCs are required to provide or offer referrals to patients for the following: social and human services, mental health services, educational and vocational services, family counseling, and HIV/AIDS counseling, prevention, and risk-reduction education. </p>
<p>The Narcotic Treatment Section of the Patient Quality Care Unit is responsible for regulating and inspecting NTCs in Texas. Currently, there are 75 NTC maintenance programs that treat approximately 11,000 opiate-addicted patients.  NTC Listing is list of currently licensed NTCs. The NTC Listing has the names, addresses, and phone numbers of NTCs by city. We enforce regulations to protect the patient, to ensure that minimum standards are met for the operation of the NTC, and to minimize the possibility of diversion of narcotic drugs outside the treatment setting.  To assist in the enforcement of regulations, we provide copies of statutes, rules, and regulations related to NTCs, and provide assistance to NTCs with interpreting and complying with the regulations. We maintain a confidential central registry of NTC patients to prevent multiple enrollment. We also answer consumer questions, provide information about NTCs, and assist patients in locating a clinic in their area. </p>
<p>Currently, two narcotic drugs are approved for the treatment of opiate addiction, methadone and buprenorphone. Both are long-acting opiate drugs that do not generate the euphoria of an opiate (IE: heroin, hydrocodone), but do reduce the symptoms of opiate withdrawal.  These drugs can be given daily. Numerous scientific studies have shown that treatment of opiate addiction with methadone or buprenorphone combined with counseling and other rehabilitative services: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Improves individual functioning</li>
	<li>Facilitates the patient's attempts to make a positive lifestyle change</li>
	<li>Reduces the amount of illicit drug use</li>
	<li>Reduces the rates of criminal activity associated with opiate addiction</li>
	<li>Reduces the incidence of health consequences of intravenous opiate addiction, such as bacterial infections, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, HIV, and sexually transmitted diseases</li>
	<li>Reduces joblessness</li>
</ul>
