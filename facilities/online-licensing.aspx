<p>The Facility Licensing Group is pleased to provide health care facilities a convenient option for paying license renewal fees over the Internet anytime 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>

<h2>Who May Renew Online?</h2>
<p>The facility license may be renewed online during the eligibility period beginning 60 days prior to the license expiration date and ending on the license expiration date. Please follow these instructions to renew online:</p>
<p>If you do not wish to renew online, you may mail the signed renewal form, other required documentation, and the licensing fee to the address printed on the license renewal forms. The license fee includes a subscription fee of $20 (authorized by Senate Bill 1152, 78th Regular Session, 2003), which must be paid whether or not you renew online. The required fee amount appears on the renewal notice.</p>
