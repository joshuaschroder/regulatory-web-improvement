<p>The Texas Birthing Center Licensing Act was first enacted in 1985 by the 69th Legislature.  A birthing center is an alternative means for a pregnant woman to deliver in a setting other than at home or in a hospital.</p>
<p>The Department develops rules that establish minimum standards for Birthing Center licensing procedures; for granting, denying, suspending, and revoking a license; for licensing fees; for operation; and for clinical standards.  Birthing Centers are not Medicare certified.</p>
