<p>The Facility Licensing Group is responsible for developing rules that establish minimum standards for licensing procedures, operational requirements, standards for voluntary agreements, enforcement procedures, fire prevention and safety requirements, and physical plant and construction requirements for private psychiatric hospitals and crisis stabilization units.</p>
<p><strong>Private psychiatric hospitals</strong> provide inpatient mental health services to individuals with mental illness or with a substance use disorder except that, at all times, a majority of the individuals admitted are individuals with a mental illness. Services include psychiatric assessment and diagnostic services, physician services, professional nursing services, and monitoring for patient safety provided in a restricted environment.</p>
<p><strong>Crisis stabilization units</strong> are mental health facilities operated by a community center or other entity designated by the Texas Department of State Health Services. They provide treatment to individuals who are the subject of a protective custody order.</p>

This helping function is termed "provider certification." Health Facility Compliance Group staff is responsible for certifying hospitals. For more information on the certification process, refer to Rules/Regulation link on right-hand side menu box or contact your zone office. See the <a href="/facilities/compliance-zones.aspx">City-Region-Zone List</a> to find your appropriate zone office.</p>
