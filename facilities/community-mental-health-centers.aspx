<p>A Community Mental Health Center (CMHC) is an entity that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Provides outpatient services, including specialized outpatient services for children, the elderly, individuals who are chronically mentally ill, and residents of its mental health service area who have been discharged from inpatient treatment at a mental health facility; </li>
	<li>Provides 24-hour-a-day emergency care services; </li>
	<li>Provides day treatment or other partial hospitalization services, or psychosocial rehabilitation services; and </li>
	<li>Provides screening for patients being considered for admission to state mental health facilities to determine the appropriateness of such admission. </li>
</ul>

<p>Community Mental Health Centers are not state licensed nor are they accredited. They may be certified to participate in the federal Medicare Program.</p>
<hr />

<h2>Provider Certification</h2>
<p>The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) directs state health agencies or other appropriate agencies to determine if health care entities meet federal standards. This helping function is termed "provider certification." Health Facility Compliance Group staff is responsible for certifying Comprehensive Out-Patient Rehabilitation Facilities.</p> 
<p>For more information on the certification process, refer to the <a title="Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Information page" href="/facilities/cms-certification.aspx">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Information page</a>, or contact your zone office. See the <a title="City-Region-Zone List" href="/facilities/compliance-zones.aspx">City-Region-Zone List</a> to find your appropriate zone office. </p>
