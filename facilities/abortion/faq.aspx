<h2 id="hsc171.004"><a title="HSC Section 171.004" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/HS/htm/HS.171.htm#171.004">&#167; 171.004</a> - Abortion Of A Fetus Age 16 Weeks Or More</h2>
<p>An abortion of a fetus age 16 weeks or more may be performed only at an ambulatory surgical center or hospital licensed to perform the abortion.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>1. May an abortion procedure on a greater than or equal to sixteen week fetus be started in a doctor's office or licensed abortion facility (such as medications administered or laminaria inserted into the cervix) and completed in an ASC or Hospital (surgical abortion)?<br/><br/>Two categories a) interventions that do not cause fetal death and b) interventions that do cause fetal death?<br/><br/></dt>
	<dd>ANSWER: No. HSC Chapter 171 defines abortion as "the use of any means to terminate the pregnancy of a female known by the attending physician to be pregnant with the intention that the termination of the pregnancy by those means will, with reasonable likelihood, cause the death of the fetus".  Interventions that cause fetal death would be performing an abortion even if the procedure was not completed in an abortion facility or physician's office. Interventions that begin to prepare the woman's body for an abortion procedure with the intent of completing an abortion procedure at a later time meets the definition of abortion.<br/><br/></dd>
	<dt>2. The Woman's Right to Know Booklet states "The age of an unborn child is most often defined by gestational age, which is measured from the first day of the last normal menstrual period. Because some women have irregular periods, other ways are also used to help date the pregnancy.<br/><br/> One way is to measure the length of the unborn child by ultrasound." For purposes of determining a fetus is less than sixteen weeks, may the doctor apply "medical judgment" using other methods available such as physical examination, positive pregnancy testing, and ultrasound to determine probable fetal age?<br/><br/></dt>
	<dd>ANSWER: Yes. In an abortion facility, determining the age of the fetus is under the direction of the facility's physician. The physician's medical judgment, after examining the woman and reviewing her history and any other information the physician elects to use, should be the means of determining fetal age prior to performing an abortion procedure.<br/><br/></dd>
	<dt>3. May a licensed abortion facility perform a surgical dilation and evacuation of a fetal demise if the demise has been confirmed before the facility provides services to a woman who has been diagnosed with fetal demise? Does it make a difference at what age the fetal demise is?<br/><br/></dt>
	<dd>ANSWER:  No.  The procedure you describe -- removal of a dead fetus -- does not meet the definition of an abortion, so the provisions of HSC Chapter 171 do not apply to it.A procedure performed in order to remove a dead fetus is also excluded from regulation under Chapter 245 of the Health and Safety Code concerning the regulation of abortion facilities in Texas.  The age of the fetus is not relevant, since this procedure, performed at any gestational age, does not meet the definition of an abortion. The abortion facility is not required to be licensed to perform this procedure.<br/><br/></dd>

<h2  id="hsc171.012" title="voluntary"><a title="Voluntary And Informed Consent" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/HS/htm/HS.171.htm#171.012">&#167; 171.012</a> Voluntary And Informed Consent</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>4. May a referral physician or the physician who is to perform the abortion, use a pre-recorded tape to "orally by telephone" inform the woman on whom an abortion is to be performed of the information required by Section 171.012 (1)(A)-(D). Two categories a) taped by the facility medical director who is not the doctor who will perform the procedure and b) taped by the doctor who will perform the procedure. <br/><br/></dt>
	<dd>ANSWER: HSC Chapter 171.012(b) states "the information provided to the woman under Subsection (a)(1)&amp;(2) must be provided: (1) orally by telephone or in person; and (2) at least 24 hours before the abortion is to be performed." The facility must have mechanisms in place to ensure (1) that the information is provided to the woman by the <em>referring physician or the physician who is to perform the procedure</em> for Sec. 171.012(a)(1)(A)-(D);  (2) that the physician who is to perform the abortion or the physician's agent provides the woman with the information required in Sec. 171.012(a)(2)(A)-(D); <em>and</em> (3) that this is done at least 24 hours before the abortion is to be performed.   So, yes, taping is acceptable, <strong><em>however</em></strong> the referring physician or the physician who will perform the abortion must be the person on the tape and the information must be specific to the gestational age.<br/><br/></dd>
	<dt>5. Can a taped message provided by the physician state "your probable gestational age is under 16 weeks" and then provide the rest of the required information for Health &amp; Safety Code, Chapter 171?<br/><br/></dt>
	<dd>ANSWER:  No. It is the physician who must decide what increments in gestational age (under 16 weeks) is appropriate for the purpose of providing the information required by Health &amp; Safety Code, Chapter 171.<br/><br/></dd>
	<dt>6. If the woman is given one probable gestational age over the phone and when she comes into the facility for a procedure it is determined that her gestational age is different, does the physician have to provide information about the revised gestational age and have the woman wait 24 hours before a procedure may be performed?<br/><br/></dt>
	<dd>ANSWER:  Yes. If the gestational age determined by the physician when the woman presents to the facility is different from the gestational age provided by phone, the woman is to be provided information based upon the revised gestational age and must wait 24 hours before an abortion procedure may be performed.<br/><br/></dd>
	<dt>7. What if the woman was provided her probable gestational age per phone, then listens to information specific to her probable gestational age and information for all gestational ages from conception to under 16 weeks. Must she wait an additional 24 hours when she comes to the facility and is determined to be a different gestational age? <br/><br/></dt>
	<dd>ANSWER: Yes. The woman may not have listened to the other gestational age information at the time if it did not pertain to the gestational age that was provided to her.<br/><br/></dd>
	<dt>8. Can the tape speak to a range of probable gestational age such as from 6-8 weeks, 9-10 weeks, 11-12 weeks, 13-15 weeks? <br/><br/></dt>
	<dd>ANSWER: Yes, the tape may speak to a range of probable gestational ages if determined by the physician to be appropriate.<br/><br/></dd>
	<dt>9. May this information be provided via a live "conference call" during which the physician talks to whomever is on the call? The callers will not be able to participate, only listen. Verification that a woman listened to a call at a specific date and time is through a password and is documented in the woman's clinical record. <br/><br/></dt>
	<dd>ANSWER: Yes, as long as mechanisms are in place to ensure that all the provisions in Sec. 171.012(a)-(d) have been met.<br/><br/></dd>
	<dt>10. May a physician delegate the calculation of the "probable gestational age" to the physician's agent?<br/><br/></dt>
	<dd>ANSWER: Yes, as long as the referring physician, or the physician who is to perform the abortion, is the one who provides the woman with the probable gestational age at least 24 hours before the abortion is performed.<br/><br/></dd>
	<dt>11. May the physician inform the patient of how to calculate her own "probable gestational age"?<br/><br/></dt>
	<dd>ANSWER: Yes, but this does not release the referring physician, or the physician who is to perform the abortion, from their responsibility to provide the woman with the probable gestational age at least 24 hours before the abortion is performed.<br/><br/></dd>
	<dt>12. May the "probable gestational age" be given as a range of more than one week?<br/><br/></dt>
	<dd>ANSWER: The physician should decide if it is appropriate to provide a woman with a range of greater than one week for a particular pregnancy.<br/><br/></dd>

<p>Sec. 240.023(d) "An abortion facility shall provide to a woman, at the time the woman initially consults the facility, a written statement indicating <a title="" href="http://info.sos.state.tx.us/fids/25_0139_0006-2.html">the number of the toll-free telephone line</a>..."</p>
<dl>
	<dt>13. Is a telephone conversation between a woman and facility staff, during which time the "informed consent" information is provided to and an appointment is scheduled for a woman, considered "the initial consult"?<br/><br/></dt>
	<dd>ANSWER: Yes. 25 TAC, Section 139.50(a) Disclosure Requirements states, "at the time of a woman's initial consultation with a licensed abortion facility, the facility shall comply with the following," and lists information required to be provided at that time.<br/><br/></dd>
	<dt>14. Could the initial phone conversation between a woman and a facility be documented as scheduling an appointment and providing the Woman's Right to Know information for purposes of the 24 hour waiting requirement and the initial consult be the day the woman presents to the facility?<br/><br/></dt>
	<dd>ANSWER: No. However, the written information required by 25 TAC &amp;sect;139.50(a)(1)-(6) can be provided by fax, internet, or email. The facility must be able to verify and document how the written information was provided to the woman.<br/><br/></dd>
	<dt>15. May a facility provide the toll-free number by email or via the internet?<br/><br/></dt>
	<dd>ANSWER: Yes, if the facility can verify and document how the written information was provided to the woman.<br/><br/></dd>

<dl>
	<dt>16. If the facility does not keep these copies in each woman's clinical record, but keeps them in a central location,  can this information be discovered through legal means?<br/><br/></dt>
	<dd>ANSWER: Yes, but only in accordance with applicable laws.  Regardless of where it is kept, it is considered a part of the woman's clinical record.<br/><br/></dd>
	<dt>17. How long must the facility keep these copies and affidavits if they are kept in a central location?<br/><br/></dt>
	<dd>ANSWER: The affidavit is considered part of the woman's clinical record, regardless of where it is stored.  The retention of the affidavit would follow the same requirements as retention for the clinical record as a whole.<br/><br/></dd>
	<dt>18. If the facility keeps each woman's affidavit or copy of her ID in her clinical record, can this information be discovered through legal means?<br/><br/></dt>
	<dd>ANSWER: Yes, but only in accordance with applicable laws.  Regardless of where it is kept, it is considered a part of the woman's clinical record.<br/><br/></dd>
