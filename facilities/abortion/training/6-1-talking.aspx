<h2>Basic Counseling Skills - Be "teen friendly" &amp; Referrals</h2>

<h3>Be "Teen Friendly"</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Use the teen's own vocabulary. But don't try to be too "hip"</li>
	<li>Remain Non-Judgemental</li>
	<li>Validate feelings</li>
	<li>Offer to help</li>
</ul>

<h3>Referrals</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Inform the teen 'up front' about your legal obligations to report abuse</li>
	<li>Report abuse immediately to the Department of Family and Protective Services or to your local law enforcement agency - you do not have to do both</li>
</ul>
