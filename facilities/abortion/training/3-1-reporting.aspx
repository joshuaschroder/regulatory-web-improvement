<p>Each staff member who is licensed or certified by the state or who is an employee of the abortion facility and who, in the normal course of his or her official duties, has direct contact with children shall report suspected abuse of a child, as described in this training, and as required by law.</p>

<p>The consideration of judicial bypass by the client does not, in and of itself, relieve the person from the responsibility to report suspected child abuse, as described in this training.</p>

<p><em>This chapter will provide you with specific information on how, when and where to report the suspected abuse of a child in Texas.</em></p>
