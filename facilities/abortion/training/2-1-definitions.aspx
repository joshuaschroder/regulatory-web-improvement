<p>For the purpose of this training we will focus on sexual abuse. However, you should be aware that not all the components of the definition of "abuse" concern sexual activity.</p>
<p>The following are legal definitions that are applicable only in Texas.</p>
<p>The next three pages of this chapter will include the Texas legal definitions of "Child Abuse", "Indecency with a Child" and "Sexual Assault".</p>
