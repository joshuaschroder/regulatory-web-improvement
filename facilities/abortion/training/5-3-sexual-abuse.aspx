<h2>Symptons of Emotional Injury &amp History</h2>

<h3>Symptoms of Emotional Injury</h3>
<p>More generalized psychological impacts of sexual abuse include withdrawal, depression, sleeping and eating disorders, self-mutilation, phobias, and psychosomatic symptoms such as stomach-aches and headaches. The child may develop school problems such as frequent absence or a sudden drop in grades. The child may exhibit either poor hygiene or excessive bathing. Older children may abuse alcohol or drugs, run away, or adopt other self-destructive behaviors including suicide threats or attempts.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Knowledge that a child's injury/disease (vaginal trauma, sexually transmitted disease) is unusual for the specific age group.</li>
	<li>Knowledge of a child's history of previous or recurrent injuries/diseases.</li>
	<li>Unexplained injuries/diseases (parent/caretaker unable to explain reason for injury/disease); there are discrepancies in explanation; blame is placed on a third party; explanations are inconsistent with medical diagnosis.</li>
	<li>A young girl is pregnant or has a sexually transmitted disease. However, other information such as statements by the minor, indication of coercion, or significant age disparity between the minor and her partner may lead to a reasonable suspicion of sexual abuse that must be reported.</li>
</ul>
