<p><em>The following are legal definitions that are applicable only in Texas.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Child Abuse:</strong> Is defined in the <cite><a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/FA/htm/FA.261.htm#261.001">Texas Family Code &#167;261.001(1)</a></cite></p>

    <p>(K) causing, permitting, encouraging, engaging in, or allowing a sexual performance by a child as defined by Section 43.25, Penal Code.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>The Texas Family Code defines abuse for the purpose of a civil investigation done by Department of Family and Protective Services such that the definition applies only when the alleged perpetrator meets the description of "person responsible" in <cite><a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/FA/htm/FA.261.htm#261.001">&#167;261.001(5):</a></cite></p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/FA/htm/FA.261.htm#261.001">
    <p>(5) "Person responsible for a child's care, custody, or welfare" means a person who traditionally is responsible for a child's care, custody, or welfare, including:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>(A) a parent, guardian, managing or possessory conservator, or foster parent of the child;</p>
        <p>(B) a member of the child's family or household as defined by Chapter 71;</p>
        <p>(C) a person with whom the child's parent cohabits;</p>
        <p>(D) school personnel or a volunteer at the child's school; or</p>
        <p>(E) personnel or a volunteer at a public or private child-care facility that provides services for the child or at a public or private residential institution or facility where the child resides.</p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>    
<hr/>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although children experience a wide variety of negative situations, the law allows Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) to investigate abuse only if a person listed above was responsible. However, DFPS has agreed to take reports on all suspected abuse cases from abortion facility staff. If you suspect child abuse, you also have the option of reporting directly to local law enforcement.</p>
