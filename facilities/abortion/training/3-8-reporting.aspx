<h2>Information regarding Reporting: Affirmative Defense</h2>
<p><strong>The professional should ask questions about the age of the partner in order to determine if an "affirmative defense" exists. This is a good faith determination.</strong></p>
<p>Penal Code &#167;21.11 (b) provides the following affirmative defense to the offense of "indecency with a child"</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/docs/pe/htm/pe.21.htm#21.11">
	(b) It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under this section that the actor:
	<blockquote>
		(1) was not more than three years older than the victim and of the opposite sex;<br/>
		(2) did not use duress, force, or threat against the victim at the time of the offenses; and<br/>
		(3) at the time of the offense:<br/>
		<blockquote>
			(A) was not required under Chapter 62, Code of Criminal Procedure, to register for life as a sex offender; or<br/>
			(B) was not a person who under Chapter 62 had a reportable conviction or adjudication for an offense under this section.
		</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Note: There is no affirmative defense for abuse of a child under 14. <br/>
Texas law states that a child under 14 cannot consent to sexual activity.</em></strong></p>
