<h2>Definitions and Statutory References</h2>
<p>Indecency with a child: Is defined by <a title="Section 21.11 Texas Penal Code" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/docs/pe/htm/pe.21.htm#21.11">&#167;21.11 Texas Penal Code</a>.</p>
<p>It means, in part, engaging in sexual contact with a child younger than 17 years of age and not the minors spouse, whether the child is of the same or opposite sex. There is an exception if the older partner is not more than 3 years older than the victim and did not use duress, force, or threat. Indecency with a child can occur even when the minor believes the activity was consensual. This is often referred to as statutory rape, however this is not a legal term in Texas.</p>
