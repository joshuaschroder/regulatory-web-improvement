<h2>Information regarding Reporting: Reporting Required</h2>
<p><strong>You must report if:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The minor is unmarried, under 14 years of age and has engaged in "sexual contact" or is pregnant.</li>
	<li>If, based on the evidence available, the staffer has cause to believe  the child has had sexual contact or has been the victim of sexual assault, REPORT. </li>
	<li>If the minor is pregnant, has never been married, is 14, 15, or 16 years of age and either her partner is more than three years older or the partner used duress, force or a threat against the victim at the time of the offense, REPORT.</li>
</ul>
<p>Circumstances that may trigger the responsibility of the abortion facility staff members to determine if a report of abuse is required, include, but are not limited to the following: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Minors (under the age of 17) who have never been married who are pregnant</li>
	<li>Minors (under the age of 17) who have never been married who request a pregnancy test </li>
	<li>Minors (under the age of 17) who have never been married who self-report they have a sexually transmitted disease.</li>
</ul>
<p>The facility may, but is not required to, request documentation that a minor is married.</p>
<p>The facility may choose to rely on statements by the minor as to his/her marital status.</p>
