<h2>Information regarding Reporting: Confidentiality</h2>
<p>&#167;261.001, Family Code, states that reporting requirements apply regardless of professional confidentiality and licensing laws and rules for professionals. It is not a breach of confidentiality to report child abuse.</p>
<p>For those programs also governed by federal laws, regulations, and policies, the federal grantors do not consider it a breach of confidentiality to follow state laws on reporting of child abuse.</p>
<p>Family Code &#167;261.201 provides that reports of abuse to DFPS as well as the identity of the person making the report, are confidential and may be disclosed only for purposes consistent with the Family Code and applicable state or federal law or regulations. The law is not absolutely clear on what discretion law enforcement has regarding disclosure of the identity of the person making the report. DSHS recommends discussion of this with your facility's own legal counsel and/or local law enforcement about how this will be handled.</p>
