<h2>Basic Counseling Skills - Phrasing/Tone of Voice &amp; Confidentiality</h2>

<h3>Phrasing/Tone of Voice</h3>

<ul>
	<li>If adolescents feel the counselor disapproves, the client will stop sharing information</li>
	<li>The clinician will not make a "connection" with the client if he or she looks down on the experience and shows it</li>
	<li>Reassure the teen that she/he did the right thing by telling you about the abuse and that you will help them stay safe</li>
</ul>

<h2>Confidentiality</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Do not promise to keep the secret</li>
	<li>Be honest about mandatory reporting requirements</li>
	<li>This is extremely important, especially when minors are involved</li>
	<li>This can be a problem in small communities where everyone knows everyone</li>
</ul>
