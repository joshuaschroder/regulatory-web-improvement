<h2>Basic Counseling Skills - Time &amp; Listening</h2>

<h3>Time</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Managing time is important</li>
	<li>Either ignoring a situation or starting a conversation that cannot be finished is a disservice to the client</li>
</ul>

<h3>Listening</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Helps draw information out of client without pushing</li>
	<li>Ask questions and then listen carefully to the answer</li>
	<li>Do not ask leading questions</li>
	<li>Do not push for details</li>
	<li>Let the authorities investigate, not you</li>
	<li>Stay calm. Keep your own emotions under control</li>
</ul>
