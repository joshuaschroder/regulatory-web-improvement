<h2>Sexually Transmitted Disease, Pregnancy, &amp; Specific Behavioral Indicators Of Sexual Abuse</h2>

<h3>Sexually Transmitted Disease And Pregnancy</h3>
<p>Physical indicators of sexual abuse include symptoms of sexually transmitted disease (STD) as well as pregnancy. Reasonable suspicions must be reported to DFPS (1-800-252-5400) and/or law enforcement. Professionals have the ability to submit reports/concerns via a secured, guided internet site (see Chapter 3).</p>

<h3>Specific Behavioral Indicators Of Sexual Abuse</h3>
<p>Children who have been sexually abused may be identified by their frequent expressions (verbal references, pictures, pretend games) of sexual activity between adults and children or by knowledge about sexual relations beyond what is probable for their age. They may masturbate inappropriately or compulsively. Their behavior may be sexually suggestive, inappropriate, or promiscuous; or, conversely, they may show infantile behavior or extreme fear of being alone with adults of a particular sex. A very strong indication that a child has been abused is that child's sexual victimization of other children.</p>
