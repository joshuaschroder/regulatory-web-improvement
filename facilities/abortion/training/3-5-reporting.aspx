<h2>Information concerning Child Abuse That Must Be Reported</h2>
<p>A. Name and address of minor, if known;</p>
<p>B. Name and address of the minor's parent or person responsible for the care, custody, or welfare of the child if not the parent, if known (this is helpful but not required); and</p>
<p>C. Any other pertinent information concerning the alleged or suspected abuse, if known. If the staff do not routinely collect other kinds of information DFPS or local law enforcement may request, the professional is not required by law or the DSHS policy to ask the client for that information.</p>
