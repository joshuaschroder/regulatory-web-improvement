<h2>Internal Policy and Procedures</h2>
<p>Each facility should develop an internal policy and procedures that describe how it will determine, document, and report instances of abuse, sexual or nonsexual, in accordance with the <a title="Texas Family Code, Chapter 261" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/FA/htm/FA.261.htm">Texas Family Code, Chapter 261</a>.</p>
<p>However, it is the responsibility of the individual to report.</p>
<p><strong>A good internal policy should clearly describe:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>The process staff members may use to determine if a report of abuse is required for minor clients who are not married or have never been married;</li>
    <li>Documentation of what constitutes abuse. This should match the provisions of the laws on the reporting of child abuse;</li>
    <li>The proper timeframes for reporting;</li>
    <li>Protocol for internal documentation of report.</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) takes reports based on whether or not the information obtained from the reporter, plus consideration of other information in the Children's Protective Service (CPS) database that may exist regarding the family "appears to meet" the TFC definitions of abuse.</p>
<p>The reporter does not have to have "proof" of abuse. Obtaining information and/or "proof" that abuse did or did not occur is the job of CPS staff.</p>
<p>The DFPS staff that respond to Hotline calls are available to assist you in making your report and to provide information. They can also provide referral information about other community resources if necessary.</p>
