<p>Chapter 33, Family Code requires notification to a minor's parents or legal guardian at least 48 hours prior to the abortion procedure being performed. Compliance with the notification requirement under Chapter 33 does not relieve the professional from separate reporting of child sexual abuse as previously described.</p>
<p>&#167;33.008, Family Code, still requires a physician to report child abuse as defined in 261.001 to DFPS. This section actually authorizes DFPS to assist the minor in making an application for judicial bypass.</p>
<p>&#167;33.009, Family Code specifically requires the court, the guardian ad litem, or the attorney ad litem for the minor to report child sexual abuse when judicial bypass is being considered. </p>
