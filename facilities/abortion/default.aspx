<p>The Texas Abortion Facility Licensing Act was first enacted in 1989 by the 71st Legislature.  The Department develops rules that establish minimum standards for Abortion Facility licensing procedures; for granting, denying, suspending, and revoking a license; for licensing fees; for operation; and for clinical standards.  Abortion Facilities are not Medicare certified.</p>
<p>The <a title="Health &amp; Safety Code, Chapter 245. Abortion Facilities" href="/facilities/abortion/laws-rules.aspx">Health &amp; Safety Code, Chapter 245. Abortion Facilities</a> (statute) requires a "universal reporting" of abortion procedures by ALL providers of abortion services. The statute contains strict confidentiality provisions relating to the release by the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) of any information pertaining to an abortion facility. The statute does allow for the release of statistical information reported to the DSHS by January 31 of each year. This information is compiled with assistance of the DSHS Bureau for Vital Statistics. The latest abortion information may be found within the DSHS Center for Health Statistics <a title="Vital Statistics Annual Reports" href="http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/CHS/VSTAT/annrpts.shtm">Vital Statistics Annual Reports</a>.</p>
