<p>House Bill (HB) 677, passed during the 79th Regular Session of the Texas Legislature, became effective on September 1, 2005. This law establishes specific requirements relating to emergency services for sexual assault survivors and added Chapter 323 to the Health and Safety Code, which pertains to hospital licensing. One of the requirements of HB 677 mandates that the Department of State Health Services develop standardized information that your health care facility must provide to sexual assault survivors. </p>

<p>House Bill 2626, passed during the 81st Regular Session of the Texas Legislature, became effective on September 1, 2009. The requirements for information provided to sexual assault survivors are amended to provide for protection harm when cooperating with law enforcement during prosecution efforts. Survivors may consent to a forensic exam to collect evidence within 96 hours of the assault, even if they do not report the assault to law enforcement. The Department of Public Safety will pay the costs of the forensic exam. The evidence collected will be kept for two years or the date the survivor releases the information by written consent.</p>
