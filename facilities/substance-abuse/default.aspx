<p>A substance abuse treatment facility may be any facility that offers treatment for persons with chemical dependency. Texas Health and Safety Code, Chapter 464, requires facilities providing substance abuse treatment services to be licensed by the Texas Department of State Health Services (Department). In addition, the Department is charged with the registration of faith-based chemical dependency treatment programs that are exempt from licensure. Faith-based chemical dependency treatment programs offer only nonmedical treatment and recovery methods such as prayer, moral guidance, spiritual counseling, and scriptural study. Substance abuse treatment facilities are not certified to participate in the federal Medicare Program.</p>
<p>The Substance Abuse Facility Licensing Group develops rules that establish minimum standards for substance abuse treatment facility licensing procedures and registration procedures for faith-based exempt programs; for granting, denying, suspending and revoking a license; for licensing fees; and for operation and care.</p>
