<p>The Texas Freestanding Emergency Medical Care Facility (FEC) Licensing Act was first enacted in 2009 by the 81st Legislature.  A freestanding emergency medical care facility is a facility that is structurally separate and distinct from a hospital and which receives an individual and provides emergency care. Emergency care is defined as health care services provided in a freestanding emergency medical care facility to evaluate and stabilize a medical condition of a recent onset and severity, including severe pain, psychiatric disturbances, or symptoms of substance abuse, that would lead a prudent layperson possessing an average knowledge of medicine and health to believe that the person's condition, sickness, or injury is of such a nature that failure to get immediate medical care could result in: </p>
<ul>
	<li>placing the person's health in serious jeopardy</li>
	<li>serious impairment to bodily functions</li>
	<li>serious dysfunction of a bodily organ or part</li>
	<li>serious disfigurement</li>
	<li>or in the case of a pregnant woman, serious jeopardy to the health of the woman or fetus</li>
</ul>
<p>The Department develops rules that establish minimum standards for licensing procedures; for granting, denying, suspending, and revoking a license; for licensing fees; for operation; and for requirements concerning design, construction.</p>
