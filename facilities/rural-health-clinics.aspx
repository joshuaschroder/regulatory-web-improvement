<p>A Rural Health Clinic is a clinic located in a rural area designated as a shortage area. It may not exist as a rehabilitation agency or function primarily as a care and treatment facility for mental diseases.</p>
<p>Rural Health Clinics are not state licensed nor are they accredited. They may be certified to participate in the federal Medicare Program.</p>
