<p>Patient safety is a critical component of quality. We can not improve patient safety simply by punishing health care workers for human errors. </p>
<p>The problem is seldom the fault of the individual, it is the fault of the system. To truly improve patient safety, we must focus on creating systems that minimize the opportunities for human error and mistakes. Systems that forcus on prevention, not punishment. Establishing a culture of safety where people are able to report adverse events and close calls without fear of punishment is the key to making patient safety a reality.</p>
