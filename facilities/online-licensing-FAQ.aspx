	<dt id="eligibility">Who is eligible to renew online?</dt>
	<dd><p>Any licensee whose license is active and within 60 days prior to expiration. The Facility Licensing Group, Texas Department of State Health Services, sends out renewal notices to each licensee approximately 90 days prior to the expiration date of the license.</p></dd>
	<dt id="start">How do I go about renewing online?</dt>
	<dd><p>Begin by visiting the <a href="/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&amp;amp;ItemID=8589993725" title="Online License Renewals">Online License Renewals</a> page. Read the instructions carefully, and follow the link on that page to the online licensing system.</p></dd>
	<dt id="work">How does the online renewal process work?</dt>
	<dd><p>The online renewal process is a simple process. The first step is to register as a First Time User or login with your User ID and Password. A change of mailing address and/or contact information address can be completed in conjunction with the renewal. The next steps are to review information and proceed to the payment page. After providing payment information, the final step is to view and print the transaction receipt. Renewal forms must also be completed, signed and returned to the Facility Licensing Group with any other required documentation by mail or fax before the renewal process is complete.</p></dd>
