<p>The TMDP was established by the 65th Legislature in 1977. The panel is appointed by the Commissioner of Health and is comprised of nine members; three members licensed to practice law in Texas and six members licensed to practice medicine in Texas. </p>
<p>The purpose of the Texas Medical Disclosure Panel (TMDP) is to determine which risks and hazards related to medical care and surgical procedures must be disclosed by health care providers or physicians to their patients or persons authorized to consent for their patients, and to establish the general form and substance of such disclosure. </p>
<p>The panel identifies and makes a thorough examination of all medical treatments and surgical procedures in which physicians and health care providers may be involved in order to determine which of those treatments and procedures do and do not require disclosure of the risks and hazards to the patients or persons authorized to consent for the patients. </p>
