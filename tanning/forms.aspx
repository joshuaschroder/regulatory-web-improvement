<h2>Online Licensing</h2>
<p>Tanning facilities may use the <a title="Regulatory Services Online Licensing System" href="https://vo.ras.dshs.state.tx.us/">Regulatory Services Online Licensing System</a> to apply for initial licenses, renew existing licenses, and to file a change of ownership (including legal entity).</p>
<p>At this time, we are currently unable to process minor amendment changes (such as name and address changes) online. Please refer to the appropriate form below.</p>
