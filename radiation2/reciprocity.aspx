<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Reciprocity, also known as reciprocal recognition, is a required authorization to perform licensed activities in Texas for any person who holds a valid specific radioactive material license or certificate of registration. The license must be from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or any other agreement state or licensing state from the jurisdiction where you maintain an office and conduct the licensed activity.</p>
<p>In other words, we will accept or recognize a license or certificate of registration from another jurisdiction as meeting our licensing/registration requirements and allow the licensee/registrant to work in Texas once all the following requirements are met.</p>
