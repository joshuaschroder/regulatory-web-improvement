<h2>Tips For Responding to a Notice of Violation</h2>
<p>After an inspection is conducted at your facility by a Department of State Health Services (DSHS) Inspector, you may need to respond to a Notice of Violation (NOV). You have 30 days from the date of the NOV to respond in writing. The following tips should help you in completing your response correctly:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Carefully read the "Notice of Violation Explanation and Guide for Response" included with the notice.<br /><br /></li>
	<li>Answer each violation separately. Include steps taken to correct each violation, how you will prevent recurrence and the date that compliance was achieved.<br /><br /></li>
	<li>Your response letter should answer only one NOV.<br /><br /></li>
	<li>Do not request a change to your license when answering a NOV. This will delay processing your response.<br /><br /></li>
	<li>Only send accompanying documentation if requested by DSHS. If requested, do not send original documents.<br /><br /></li>
	<li>Do not write your corrective actions on the notice and return this as your response.<br /><br /></li>
	<li>Do not respond by only sending a copy of the documentation you were cited for not having.<br /><br /></li>
	<li>For help in responding to your notice, call the technical reviewer listed on the notice.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
