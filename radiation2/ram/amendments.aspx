<h2>General Guidance</h2>
<p>Submit your amendment request by writing a letter describing changes requested to your Radioactive Material License. No fee is required to amend an active license.  In order to expedite your request remember to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Provide justification for your request</li>
	<li>Clearly describe what changes you want on the license</li>
	<li>Include applicable attachments (i.e. facility diagrams, training certificate, certification statement)</li>
	<li>Reference your license number on the request</li>
	<li>Date your request</li>
	<li>Be sure the request is signed by the radiation safety officer or officer of the company</li>
</ul>

<h3>Helpful Tips</h3>
<p>Avoid submitting a request for an amendment that addresses other Department of State Health Services related issues (i.e. response to Notice of Violation, fees, etc.).</p>
<p>Avoid addressing similar issues that affect more than one license or registration in one request. Submit a separate request for each license or registration.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Addressing Your Amendment Request</h2>
<p>Be sure to address your request to the appropriate licensing program. There is no need to specify an individual's name in your request.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Industrial Licensing Program (Includes, General License Acknowledgments and NORM)</li>
	<li>Medical and Academic Licensing Program</li>
	<li>Advanced Technology Licensing Program</li>
</ul>
