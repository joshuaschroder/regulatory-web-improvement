<h2>Policy on Medical Practice for Diagnostic Nuclear Medicine</h2>
<p>A radioactive material license which authorizes medical use of radioactive material may constrain the actions of the licensed entity. In accordance with the Medical Practice Act Section 1.02.(8), nothing in a license issued for medical uses of radioactive material shall be construed as limiting the clinical administration of Food and Drug Administration approved pharmaceuticals to a patient for imaging and localization studies by an appropriately approved physician user named on the license.</p>
