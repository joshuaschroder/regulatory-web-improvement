<h2>Attention: Change in Agency Policy</h2>
<p>Due to security and accountability concerns, Radiation Control will no longer authorize radioactive material quantities as "No single source to exceed..." for sealed sources. Therefore, you will need to specify a specific number of devices you need authorization for.</p>
<p>With your next amendment request or renewal provide the following information:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Provide a list of the device model numbers you currently have in your possession</li>
	<li>Indicate a total number of devices, for each model you need authorization for</li>
</ol>
<p>We understand you need to have authorization for a sufficient number of devices to conduct routine business and this number may be more than what you actually possess.</p>

<h2>Radioactive Materials Program Authorization and Scope</h2>

<p>Regulation of radioactive material fuel sources in nuclear reactors and the byproduct materials that result from the nuclear fission is regulated by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. States with Agreement State status can maintain authority over byproduct material. However, in States without <a title="Agreement State" href="http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/state-tribal/agreement-states.html">Agreement State</a> status, the NRC retains authority over byproduct material.</p>

<p>States become an Agreement States by establishing programs to assume NRC regulatory authority under the <a title="Atomic Energy Act of 1954" href="http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/governing-laws.html#aea-1954">Atomic Energy Act of 1954</a>, as amended. Section 274 of the Act provides a statutory basis under which NRC relinquishes to the States portions of its regulatory authority to license and regulate byproduct materials (radioisotopes); source materials (uranium and thorium); and certain quantities of special nuclear materials. The mechanism for the transfer of NRC's authority to a State is an agreement signed by the Governor of the State and the Chairman of the Commission, in accordance with section 274b of the Act.  Agreement States are required to maintain compatibility with NRC’s program and are routinely reviewed every four years for adequacy and compatibility by NRC’s Management Review Board.</p>

<p>Texas became an Agreement State in 1963 and has regulated these radioactive materials since. Texas had previously regulated Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials over which NRC did not have authority to regulate. In addition, Texas regulates sources of radiation from lasers and x-ray machines including mammography, over which NRC does not have regulatory authority.</p>

<p>Overall, the Texas Radiation Control Program totals approximately 25% Radioactive Materials permits and approximately 75% X-Ray, Mammography, and Laser permits.</p>
