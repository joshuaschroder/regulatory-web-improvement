<p><strong>What Written Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) Am I Required to Maintain?</strong></p>
<p>You are required to maintain all written procedures required in 21 CFR, Part 205 - Section 205.50(g); among these are SOP’s for receipt, security, storage, recall, inventory (including correcting all errors and inaccuracies), and distribution of prescription drugs, identifying, recording, and reporting losses or thefts, returns, and disaster preparedness.</p>

<p><strong>Who Can Possess a Prescription Drug?</strong></p>
<p><a title="Health and Safety Code Chapter 483, Texas Dangerous Drug Act" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/HS/htm/HS.483.htm">Health and Safety Code Chapter 483</a>, Texas Dangerous Drug Act, designates the following persons as authorized to possess a dangerous drug. For complete definitions of each of these terms please refer to the Dangerous Drug Act (available on our website):</p>
<ul>
	<li>Pharmacies licensed by the Texas State Board of Pharmacy</li>
	<li>Practitioners (for example: medical doctors, dentists)</li>
	<li>Persons who obtain a dangerous drug for lawful research, teaching, or testing, but not for resale</li>
	<li>Hospitals that obtain a dangerous drug for lawful administration by a practitioner</li>
	<li>Officers or employees of the federal, state, or local government</li>

<p><strong>If My Firm Distributes Medical Gas Cylinders Am I Required to Separate My Full Cylinders from My Empty Cylinders?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. According to 21 CFR, Part 205 – Section 205.50(a)(1), “All facilities at which prescription drugs are stored, warehoused, handled, held, offered, marketed, or displayed, shall be of suitable size and construction to facilitate cleaning, maintenance, and proper operations.” Further, 21 CFR, Part 205 -- Section 205.50(a)(4) states that the facility will "be maintained in a clean and orderly condition." To facilitate proper operations and orderly conditions, your firm must segregate full cylinders from empty cylinders and industrial gases from medical gases if applicable.</p>

<p><strong>What If I Also Distribute Medical Devices, Such as Nebulizers, Catheters, and Oxygen Concentrators? Do I Need an Additional License?</strong></p>
<p>If your firm distributes medical devices, you will likely need a license to distribute them. You may be eligible for a multiple product license, which is one license that covers multiple activities (distribution of drugs and/or medical devices and/or foods). Visit the <a title="applications and forms" href="/drugs/forms.aspx">applications and forms</a> page or call (512) 834-6626 (Licensing) for more information. </p>
