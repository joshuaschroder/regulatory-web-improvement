<p>The Drugs and Medical Devices Group is responsible for ensuring that drug manufacturers and distributors comply with minimum licensing standards established to protect the health and safety of of the citizens of Texas.  In order to accomplish this objective, inspections of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drug manufacturers and distributors are conducted.  If voluntary compliance with the licensing standards cannot be achieved, the Group recommends regulatory actions when necessary.  In addition, the Group provides technical assistance to its licensees, answers inquiries from consumers and investigates complaints involving possible violations of the state requirements for drug manufacturers and distributors.</p>
