<p>This program is responsible for ensuring that human and animal drugs and biologicals are safe, properly labeled, do not contain harmful additives and do not make any unsubstantiated or fraudulent claims.</p>
<p>The Drugs and Medical Devices Group conducts inspections of manufacturers and distributors of drugs in order to determine compliance with applicable state and federal requirements.  Businesses engaged in the distribution or manufacture of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs or prescription drugs in Texas are required to license with the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS).  In addition, businesses located outside Texas who engage in the distribution of OTC or prescription drugs in this state must license as out-of-state distributors with DSHS.</p>
