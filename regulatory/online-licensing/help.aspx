</ul>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" name="add-license" title="add a license to your account"></a>
<h2>Add a License to Your Account</h2>
<p>If your licenses are not present on the Main Menu, you may add additional licenses by selecting the "Add Licenses to Registration" button, as shown in the image below.</p>
<p><img style="width:100%; height:auto;" src="/regulatory/online-licensing/img/add-licenses.png" alt="Add Licenses to Registration"/></p>
<p>The next screen will prompt you with a question, asking if you are a license holder for the license type you are attempting to add. Please read all instructions on the screen and select "Next."</p>
<p><img style="width:100%; height:auto;" src="/regulatory/online-licensing/img/add-licenses-2.png" alt="Add a License Eligibility Check"/></p>
<p>From the next screen, please select the licensing board and license type that you wish to add to the account.</p>
<p><img style="width:100%; height:auto;" src="/regulatory/online-licensing/img/add-licenses-3.png" alt="Select Licensing Board and License Type"/></p>
<p>On the following screen, add the license number, and add any other fields requested. Complete the CAPTCHA and select "Next."</p>
<p><img style="width:100%; height:auto;" src="/regulatory/online-licensing/img/add-licenses-4.png" alt="Enter License Information"/></p>
<p>Follow the remaining prompts to complete adding the license to your account.</p>
<hr/>

<a class="bookmark" name="apply-license" title="New License Applications"></a>
<h2>New License Applications</h2>
<p>To apply for a new license, first login to the online licensing system, and choose the board of the licensing program.</p>
<p><img style="width:100%; height:auto;" src="/regulatory/online-licensing/img/apply-new.png" alt="choose the board of the licensing program"/></p>
<p>After selecting the license board, choose the exact license type application from the second list.</p>
<p><img style="width:100%; height:auto;" src="/regulatory/online-licensing/img/apply-new-2.png" alt="choose the exact license type application"/></p>
<p>Click on the "Select" button, directly across from the dropdown lists. Depending on the license type you select, you will be taken to the Introduction screen for the license type’s initial application transaction. Read and follow the directions on each screen.</p>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" name="renew-licenses" title="view your licenses"></a>
<h2>Renewal License Applications</h2>
<p>Most license programs allow renewal one to three months before license expiration date. If you are eligible for renewal, you should see a renewal listed under “It is time to Renew!” on the Main Menu after logging into the system.</p>
<p>Most licenses and registrations are renewed for two years. Check with your licensing program to confirm the renewal period.</p>
<p>Online renewals, initial license applications, and change of addresses are submitted daily to the licensing boards or programs, therefore, renewing online will expedite the renewal process by eliminating mailing time to the agency.</p>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" name="check-status" title="check status of applications"></a>
<h2>Check Status of Applications</h2>
<p>If you have previously started or completed applications, you may check their status. From the Main Menu clicking on Select button across from “Check Status of Your Applications.”</p>
<p><img style="width:100%; height:auto;" src="/regulatory/online-licensing/img/check-status-1.png" alt="“Check Status of Your Applications"/></p>
<p>Here you will see what applications you have, when they were submitted, for which license type and transaction, and their status. Open applications are not yet complete--you can select one from this screen to complete it. Approved applications have been approved by licensing staff, and more information will be forwarded to you about the process.</p>
<p><img style="width:100%; height:auto;" src="/regulatory/online-licensing/img/check-status.png" alt="list of open applications"/></p>
<p>In some instances, an application will appear with an "Open" status with the additional words "in process" in the title of the application.  This represents a secondary application which was opened by DSHS staff to complete the licensure process.  When this "in process" application has a status of "Approved", all of the necessary reviews have been completed.</p>


<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" name="pay-online" title="pay for online applications"></a>
<h2>Pay for Online Applications</h2>
<p>If you have not paid for your application(s) or chosen the "Pay Later" option after applying, you may click on the Select button and see which transactions need payment:</p>
<p><img style="width:100%; height:auto;" src="/regulatory/online-licensing/img/pay-online.png" alt="online payment -- select board to pay"/></p>
<p>First, you select the board of the license type. In this example, we will choose “Abusable Volatile Chemical Program.”</p>
<p><img style="width:100%; height:auto;" src="/regulatory/online-licensing/img/pay-online-2.png" alt="Online Application Payment - Select the applications that you wish to pay for and press next to continue"/></p>
<p>This screen shows that we have initial applications that are due to be paid if we want to complete the applications. At this point, you may choose which transaction you want to pay for by checking/unchecking the boxes next to the Fee on the right side. Then, select method of Payment; here it can be a credit card or electronic check (ACH) payment. Then click Next.</p>
<p><img style="width:100%; height:auto;" src="/regulatory/online-licensing/img/pay-online-3.png" alt="Online Application Payment - Select the applications that you wish to pay for and press next to continue"/></p>
<p>A screen to confirm your selections will appear, showing your total amount owed. Click Next to go to the payment screen to fill out payment information. Once you have successfully paid, you will be returned by the system back to VO, and a payment successful screen will appear, confirming your payment. You will also see an option to save a PDF receipt, and an e-mail receipt will be sent to your user account’s e-mail address.</p>

<a class="bookmark" name="third-party" title="third party payments"></a>
<h3>Third Party Payments</h3>
<p>Currently, EMS Personnel, EMS Educators, and EMD Instructors may use a third party to make payment on their individual license. For all other license types, only the licensee will be able to make payment on their individual license.</p>
<p>If you are the third party payer who received an email that an application was sent to you for third party payment, you will find the third party payment referral on the Main Menu under <em>Additional Activities > Pay for Online Applications</em>.</p>

<a class="bookmark" name="pay-later" title="paying later"></a>
<h3>Paying Later</h3>
<p>If you completed and submit an application online but chose the <em>Pay Later</em> option, you may go back into the sytem and pay at a later date. After logging back into the system with the same user ID that you used to submit and attest your application, you will find payment options located under <em>Additional Activities > Pay for Online Applications</em>.</p>

<a class="bookmark" name="payment-support" title="contacting payment support"></a>
<h3>Contacting Payment Support</h3>
<p>If you encounter difficulty processing an online payment, please contact the Texas.gov helpdesk at (800) 399-2969, or by email at <a title="support@texasgovhelpdesk.com" href="mailto:support@texasgovhelpdesk.com">support@texasgovhelpdesk.com</a>.</p>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" name="change-address" title="change of address"></a>
<h2>Change of Address</h2>
<p>For most license types, you may change your address at any time using the Address Change transaction. Please refer to the <a title="Online Licensing Eligibility" href="/regulatory/online-licensing/eligibility.aspx">Online Licensing Eligibility</a> page, which lists individual license types eligible for address changes online. Also, you should change your address <em>before</em> you renew, or at the time of your renewal, so that any paper license or certificate will go to the correct address.</p>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" name="update-email" title="Update Email Address"></a>
<h2>Update Email Address</h2>
<p>If your email address needs to be changed on your account, login with your user ID and click on <em>Update Profile</em>, located in the upper right corner of the Main Menu. On the "View User Profile" page, locate the section with your User ID, and click <em>Edit</em>. The "Change Personal Information" page will load, where you will be able to update your email address.</p>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" name="name-change" title="name changes"></a>
<h2>Name Changes</h2>
<p>Name changes may not be completed online. All name changes must be submitted in writing to the licensing board or program office. You must provide any documentation required by the licensing board or program. For further information, please <a title="contact your licensing board or program" href="/regulatory/online-licensing/contact.aspx">contact your licensing board or program</a>.</p>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" name="dba" title="DBA / organization name"></a>
<h2>DBA / Organization Name</h2>
<p>If you are not sure as to your correct DBA (doing business as) name or your organization name on your license, please use the <em>Check License Status</em> link on the main <a title="login page" href="https://vo.ras.dshs.state.tx.us/datamart/login.do">login page</a>.</p>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" name="locked-out" title="locked out of account"></a>
<h2>Locked Out of Account</h2>
<p>You will need to close your internet web browser, then open a new internet web browser and log in using your user ID and password. It is also a good idea to delete your browsing history or clear your cache on your internet browser. These options should resolve the issue of locking you out of the system. This error <strong>does not</strong> indicate that your user ID is locked out and needs to be unlocked in our system.</p>
