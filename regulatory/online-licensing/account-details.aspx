<h2>Change of Address</h2>
<p>For most license types, you may change your address at any time using the Address Change transaction. Please refer to the <a title="Online Licensing Eligibility" href="/regulatory/online-licensing/eligibility.aspx">Online Licensing Eligibility</a> page, which lists individual license types eligible for address changes online. Also, you should change your address <em>before</em> you renew, or at the time of your renewal, so that any paper license or certificate will go to the correct address.</p>
