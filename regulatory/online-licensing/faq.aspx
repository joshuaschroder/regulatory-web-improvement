<a class="bookmark" title="Should I apply for License" name="should-i-apply-for-license"></a><h2>If I hold a license or want to upgrade my license, should I apply for a license?</h2>
<p>It depends on the license you hold. The <a title="Who May Apply Online" href="/regulatory/online-licensing/eligibility.aspx">Who May Apply Online</a> page lists the license types that may be processed online, as well as which application types are available for that license. There are some licenses that can be applied for initially online. With some license types, you may renew, pay a billing fee, and/or change your mailing address.</p>
<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" title="3rd Party Pay" name="3rd-party-pay"></a><h2>Can a third party pay my license fee?</h2>
<p>Currently, EMS Personnel, EMS Educators, and EMD Instructors may use a third party to make payment on their individual license. For all other license types, only the licensee will be able to make payment on their individual license.</p>
<p>If you are the third party payer who received an email that an application was sent to you for third party payment, you will find the third party payment referral under “Additional Activities’, Pay for Online Applications”.</p>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" title="Can I change my addy" name="can-i-change-my-addy"></a><h2>Can I change my address at the time of renewal or between renewals?</h2>
<p>For most license types, you may change your address at any time using the Address Change transaction. Please check the Who Should Register webpage which shows which license types have the ability to change addresses. Also, you should change your address before you renew or at the time of your renewal, so that any paper license or certificate will go to the correct address.</p>
<p>You will find address change applications under “Manage your license information” on the Quick Start Menu screen after logging into the system.</p>
<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" title="Can I renew start an appl" name="can-i-renew-start-an-appl"></a><h2>Can I renew, start an application for licensure, pay a billing fee, or change my address online at any time?</h2>

<p>If your email address needs to be changed on your account, login with your user ID and click on "Update Profile". Email addresses and user IDs may be changed by editing your Personal Information.</p>
<p>If you no longer have access to your old email address and cannot reset your password to login, contact the licensing board or program using the Contact DSHS Programs link on the left side of the bottom gray bar on the main login webpage.</p>
