<h2>New License Applications</h2>
<p>To apply for a new license, first login to the <a title="online licensing system" href="https://vo.ras.dshs.state.tx.us/datamart/login.do">Online Licensing System</a>, and choose the board of the licensing program. Please see the <a title="Find Your Licensing Board" href="/regulatory/online-licensing/boards.aspx">Find Your Licensing Board or Program</a> page for more information on locating your licensing board or program.</p>
<p><img style="width:100%; height:auto;" src="/regulatory/online-licensing/img/apply-new.png" alt="choose the board of the licensing program"/></p>
<p>After selecting the license board, choose the exact license type application from the second list.</p>
<p><img style="width:100%; height:auto;" src="/regulatory/online-licensing/img/apply-new-2.png" alt="choose the exact license type application"/></p>
<p>Click on the <em>"Select"</em> button, directly across from the dropdown lists. Depending on the license type you select, you will be taken to the Introduction screen for the license type’s initial application transaction. Read and follow the directions on each screen.</p>

<h2>Renewal License Applications</h2>
<p>Most license programs allow renewal one to three months before license expiration date. If you are eligible for renewal, you should see a renewal listed under <em>“It is time to Renew!”</em> on the Main Menu after logging into the system.</p>
<p>Most licenses and registrations are renewed for two years. Check with your licensing program to confirm the renewal period.</p>
<p>Online renewals, initial license applications, and change of addresses are submitted daily to the licensing boards or programs, therefore, renewing online will expedite the renewal process by eliminating mailing time to the agency.</p>

<a class="bookmark" name="check-status" title="check status of applications"></a>
<h2>Check Status of Applications</h2>
<p>If you have previously started or completed applications, you may check their status. From the Main Menu clicking on <em>"Select"</em> button across from “Check Status of Your Applications.”</p>
<p><img style="width:100%; height:auto;" src="/regulatory/online-licensing/img/check-status-1.png" alt="“Check Status of Your Applications"/></p>
<p>Here you will see what applications you have, when they were submitted, for which license type and transaction, and their status. Open applications are not yet complete--you can select one from this screen to complete it. Approved applications have been approved by licensing staff, and more information will be forwarded to you about the process.</p>
<p><img style="width:100%; height:auto;" src="/regulatory/online-licensing/img/check-status.png" alt="list of open applications"/></p>
<p>In some instances, an application will appear with an <em>"Open" </em>status with the additional words <em>"in process"</em> in the title of the application.  This represents a secondary application which was opened by DSHS staff to complete the licensure process.  When this <em>"in process"</em> application has a status of <em>"Approved"</em>, all of the necessary reviews have been completed.</p>
