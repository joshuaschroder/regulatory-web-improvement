<p>The Hazard Communication Worker Right-to-Know Program protects the health and safety of public employees by ensuring that public employers provide information, training and appropriate personal protective equipment to their employees who may be exposed to hazardous chemicals in their workplaces.</p>

<p>Public employers include, but are not limited to, cities, counties, state agencies, public schools, public colleges and universities, and volunteer service organizations. Employees of private facilities in Texas are covered by a similar federal regulation (Hazard Communication Standard), which is administrated and enforced by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).</p>
