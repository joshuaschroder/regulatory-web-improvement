<p>The mission of the Environmental Lead Program is to protect the public, especially young children, from exposure to lead in their environment through assuring that persons conducting lead inspections, lead risk assessments, and lead abatements in target housing (built before 1978) and child-occupied facilities (built before 1978) are properly trained and certified and are following minimum standards that protect the health of workers and building occupants.</p>

<h2>Applicability of Texas Lead Regulations</h2>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned lead-based paint for residential use beginning on January 1, 1978.  As a result, the Texas Environmental Lead Reduction Rules (TELRR) were promulgated which apply to housing (also known as "target housing" by the TELRR) and child-occupied facilities (i.e., daycare centers and kindergartens) built before this date.</p>  

<p>In order to do any lead-based paint activity in these structures, such as lead inspections, lead risk assessments, lead hazard screens, or lead abatements, the individuals and firms conducting this work must be certified (licensed) by the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), Environmental Lead Program.  In the absence of testing documentation to show that no lead-based paint is present, homes and child-occupied facilities built before 1978 must be assumed to contain lead-based paint.  Commercial and industrial buildings and structures are currently not covered by these regulations.</p>

<h2>Renovation, Repair, and Painting (RRP) Regulations</h2>
<p>Please be aware of the <strong>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 2008 <a title="Renovation, Repair and Painting Program (RRP) Rule" href="http://www2.epa.gov/lead/lead-renovation-repair-and-painting-program-rules">Renovation, Repair and Painting Program (RRP) Rule</a></strong> (as amended 2010 and 2011), which became fully effective April 22, 2010.  This federal rule is being administered by the U.S. EPA in Texas.  The rule states among other things that renovations, repairs, and painting in target housing (built prior to 1978) and child-occupied facilities (built prior to 1978) must be conducted by an EPA-certified Renovation Firm (licensed by EPA) using a certified Renovator (a person who has received a Renovation training course completion certificate from an EPA-accredited trainer), and following the lead-safe work practice requirements of the federal rule.  Before renovation work commences, a homeowner of a pre-1978 constructed home or owner of a child-occupied facility built before 1978 should verify that the contactor is indeed a certified Renovator by asking for a copy of their certified Renovator certificate issued by an EPA-accredited trainer and is also working for a certified Renovation Firm (ask to see copy of the EPA-issued certified Renovation Firm certificate which is an EPA license).
