<p>The mission of the Environmental Lead Program is to protect the public, especially young children, from exposure to lead in their environment through assuring that persons conducting lead inspections, lead risk assessments, and lead abatements in target housing (built before 1978) and child-occupied facilities (built before 1978) are properly trained and certified and are following minimum standards that protect the health of workers and building occupants.</p>
