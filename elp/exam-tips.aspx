<h2>Before the Exam</h2>

<p>The certification exam is known to be challenging, and adequate preparation is highly recommended. Once you have completed the training course, use <a title="EPA's National Certification Examinations Training and Study Guide" href="http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&amp;ItemID=17269">EPA's National Certification Examinations Training and Study Guide</a> <span class="small">(PDF, 71KB)</span> as an outline in your preparation. You are also encouraged to make a list of the most important topics during your course to use as a study guide. Circle or highlight topics that you know will require extra time to study. Pay particular attention to the <a href="/elp/laws-rules.aspx">Texas Environmental Lead Reduction Rules</a> (TELRR) and the <a title="U.S Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) lead rules" href="http://www2.epa.gov/lead/lead-renovation-repair-and-painting-program-rules">U.S Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) lead rules</a>. Also note the specific chapters that pertain to your certification discipline in the <a title="U.S. Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing" href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/healthy_homes/lbp/hudguidelines">U.S. Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing</a> (commonly referred to as the "HUD Guidelines"). </p>
