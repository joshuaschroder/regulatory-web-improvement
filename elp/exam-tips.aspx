<h2>Before the Exam</h2>

<h3>Plan Ahead</h3>
<p>The certification exam is known to be challenging, and adequate preparation is highly recommended. Once you have completed the training course, use <a title="EPA's National Certification Examinations Training and Study Guide" href="http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&amp;ItemID=17269">EPA's National Certification Examinations Training and Study Guide</a> <span class="small">(PDF, 71KB)</span> as an outline in your preparation. You are also encouraged to make a list of the most important topics during your course to use as a study guide. Circle or highlight topics that you know will require extra time to study. Pay particular attention to the <a href="/elp/laws-rules.aspx">Texas Environmental Lead Reduction Rules</a> (TELRR) and the <a title="U.S Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) lead rules" href="http://www2.epa.gov/lead/lead-renovation-repair-and-painting-program-rules">U.S Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) lead rules</a>. Also note the specific chapters that pertain to your certification discipline in the <a title="U.S. Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing" href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/healthy_homes/lbp/hudguidelines">U.S. Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing</a> (commonly referred to as the "HUD Guidelines"). </p>

<h3>The Night Before</h3>
<p>Cramming the night before is not recommended. If you have followed a good study plan, you should only have to do a quick review of the course materials the night before the exam and get to bed early. You need to be well rested to do well on the exam.</p>

<h3>Exam Day</h3>
<p>Do not skip breakfast. Research shows that you do better on exams with a full stomach. Be sure to get to the exam site early and do a quick 10-minute power study right before the exam. This will help tune in your brain to the exam.</p>

<h2>During the Exam</h2>

<h3>Before You Start</h3>
<p>Scan through the exam quickly. Answer the easy questions first. This can build your confidence. On the back of the answer sheet, jot down all the standards you are trying to keep current in memory. This will allow you to focus on the exam. Do not write or make any markings on the exam question packet.</p>

<h3>Read Each Question Twice</h3>
<p>Make sure you understand what is being asked before you move to the possible answers.</p>

<h3>Read All of the Choices</h3>
<p>The process of elimination can help you choose the correct answer. Do not pick the first choice that looks good. Start by eliminating the answers that could not be right. Carefully work it through and focus on possible correct choices before selecting your answer. When you have carefully selected an answer, be reluctant to change it later, unless new information clearly indicates an error in your choice. Changes usually lead to incorrect answers.</p>

<h3>Do Not Get Frustrated</h3>
<p>If you have a trouble with a question, reread the question to make sure you understand it then try to solve it again. If you are still stuck, circle it on your answer sheet and move on. You can come back to it later. When you come back to it and you still have no idea about the correct answer, review your choices and make the best selection you can.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Before You Turn in Your Exam</h2>

<h3>Review Your Work</h3>
<p>Check for careless mistakes, such as putting the right answer in the wrong place, skipped or unanswered questions. Review all your answers carefully.</p>
