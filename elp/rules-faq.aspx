<h2>3. What Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) rules and laws regulate lead?</h2>
<p>In order to help reduce exposures to lead, the Texas Legislature passed <a title="Senate Bill 544 (SB 544)" href="/elp/laws-rules.aspx">Senate Bill 544 (SB 544)</a> in June of 1995, to ensure that individuals conducting lead-based paint abatements and removals in residential homes and multifamily dwellings are properly trained and certified by the state. As required by this legislation, DSHS has promulgated the Texas Environmental Lead Reduction Rules 25 TAC 295.201-220, which became effective on February 19, 1996. The rules were amended effective May 10, 1998 to include child-occupied facilities such as day cares and preschools, required by <a title="House Bill 729 (HB 729" href="/elp/laws-rules.aspx">House Bill 729 (HB 729)</a> passed by the 75th Legislature, 1997. The rules were amended again effective March 23, 2003, to align state rules with federal rules established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concerning <a title="lead hazard standards" href="http://www2.epa.gov/lead/hazard-standards-lead-paint-dust-and-soil-tsca-section-403">lead hazard standards</a>. On January 1, 2005, the rules were amended to accommodate the changes required by House Bill 2292, 78th Legislature, 2003, which revised <a title="Texas Health and Safety Code (HSC), &#167;&#167;12.0111 and 12.0112," href="/elp/laws-rules.aspx">Texas Health and Safety Code (HSC), &#167;&#167;12.0111 and 12.0112,</a> to require two-year licenses effective January 1, 2005; and Senate Bill 1152, 78th Legislature, 2003, which amended Government Code (GC), Chapter 2054, regarding the TexasOnline Authority. These statutes required that two-year certifications and training accreditations (instead of 3-year terms) start being issued to new applicants and existing three-year certifications, and training accreditations had to be converted to two-year terms upon renewal. Language was also added that allows for the collection of annual subscription and convenience fees to recover costs associated with processing fee payments for applications through the <a title="Regulatory Services Online Licensing System" href="https://vo.ras.dshs.state.tx.us/datamart/login.do">Regulatory Services Online Licensing System</a>.</p>

<h2>4. What do the DSHS Lead Rules require? </h2>
<p>The rules require that persons performing lead-based paint activities such as inspection, risk assessment, project design, or abatement in target housing (which includes most single and multifamily dwellings constructed prior to 1978), and child-occupied facilities (also built before 1978), must be certified by the DSHS after receiving training. Homeowners of target housing who are considering having any of these lead-based paint activities conducted should ask to see the DSHS-issued certification identification (ID) card of any of the persons that they hire. If lead-based paint in target housing is to be abated, the certified firm must submit an abatement notification form to the DSHS prior to the beginning of the job, and a fee will be assessed after receipt of the notification by DSHS. </p>

<h2>What type of structures do the Lead Rules cover? </h2>
<p>The DSHS Lead Rules apply to target housing (constructed prior to 1978), which may include single and multi-family residences, and apartment buildings, and child-occupied facilities (also built before 1978), such as preschools, kindergartens, and daycares. The rules DO NOT cover non-residential public and commercial buildings, industrial facilities, bridges, roads, or steel structures or zero-bedroom dwellings such as efficiencies, studio apartments, dormitory housing, military barracks, and rentals of individual rooms in residential dwellings.</p>
