<h2>1. When was the use of lead in paint banned? </h2>
<p>The <a title="Consumer Product Safety Commission" href="http://www.cpsc.gov/">Consumer Product Safety Commission</a> (CPSC) banned the use of lead-based paint in toys, furniture, schools and residences in 1978. Today, lead-based paint is considered to be paint containing more than 0.06% or 600 parts per million of lead. </p>

<a class="bookmark" title="2" name="2"></a>
<h2>2. How do I know if my home has lead-based paint? </h2>
<p>Homes built prior to 1978 are likely to contain lead-based paint, and homes built prior to 1950 are even more likely to have lead-based paint. The only sure way to determine if your home has lead-based paint is to have it tested by a certified inspector or risk assessor.&nbsp; For a list of certified Inspectors and Risk Assessors you may <a title="refer to this Web site" href="/elp/find-a-licensee.aspx">refer to this Web site</a> or contact the Texas Department of State Health Service, Environmental Lead Program at (512) 834-6787 ext. 2434 or 1-888-778-9440. </p>

<h2>3. Are lead test kits a good way to determine if the paint in my home contains lead? </h2>
<p>DSHS believes that lead test kits, sometimes available at home improvement stores and other sources, can be useful to determine if there is lead in your paint; however, the kits have limitations as they can only give you a positive or negative result - they cannot tell you the amount of lead that is present. Test kits can also give false negatives and false positives, especially if used improperly. As a result, if a lead abatement is to be conducted, or you need a legal statement confirming the presence or absence of lead-based paint, you must have a certified lead inspector or lead risk assessor conduct a lead inspection on your home. There are only two ways that these certified lead professionals can conduct lead inspections: 1) paint-chip collection and having the samples analyzed by an <a title="EPA-recognized laboratory" href="http://www2.epa.gov/lead/national-lead-laboratory-accreditation-program-list">EPA-recognized laboratory</a>; or through 2) X-ray fluorescence (XRF) detection. To find out who is certified by DSHS, check the certified <a title="list of lead inspectors and lead risk assessors" href="/elp/find-a-licensee.aspx">list of lead inspectors and lead risk assessors</a> or contact the Texas Department of State Health Services, Environmental &amp; Consumer Safety Section, Licensing Unit, at (512) 834-6600, ext. 2174, or&nbsp;toll-free at (888)-572-5548. </p>
