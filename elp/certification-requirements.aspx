<h4>Important Information About Lead Certifications for Individuals</h4>

<p>If you are an employer, you may pay for your employee's renewal certification through the TexasOnline application, but this certification will not be renewed until all required documents are received and approved. In order to process your certification as soon as possible, you must submit your renewal qualification package immediately following the completion of your online payment.</p>
<p>Practicing with a lapsed certification is prohibited. A person whose certification has been expired for one year or more may not renew the certification. The person may obtain a new certification by complying with the requirements and procedures, including any examination requirements, for obtaining an original (initial) certification. If a certification holder makes a timely and sufficient application for the renewal of a certification, the current certification in his/her possession does not expire until the application has been finally granted or denied by the Licensing Unit.</p>
