<h2>Definition of Youth Camp</h2>
<p>To determine if an operation is a youth camp, the operation must meet the following criteria:</p>
<ol> 
	<li>Provides supervision, instruction, and recreation</li>
	<li>Accommodates at least five minors during each camp session</li>
	<li>Operates as a youth camp for no more than 120 days each calendar year</li>
	<li>Hosts children who are apart from parents or guardians</li>
	<li>Operates as a youth camp for a period of four or more consecutive days</li>
	<li>Operates as a youth camp for more than four consecutive hours per day</li>
	<li>Operates as a youth camp only during school vacation periods</li>
	<li>Offers a variety of activities in an outdoor setting and</li>
	<li>Schedules activities so that campers spend a minimum of 60% of their time out-of-doors between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that some “camp” operations may not meet all of the criteria listed above, and would not be considered a Youth Camp operation, although they may be considered a Child Care operation. Please see the <a title="Texas Department of Family and Protective Services" href="http://www.dfps.state.tx.us/">Texas Department of Family and Protective Services</a> Web site for more information on Child Care. Additionally, some licensed youth camps may offer services that do not meet the above criteria (such as weekend retreats), and those services would not be regulated under the youth camp laws.</p>
