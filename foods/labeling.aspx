<h2>Regulations and Exemptions</h2>

<p>The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, also known as NLEA, brought about the requirement for nutrition labeling to be carried on most foods. It also allowed for nutrient content claims (example: Low Fat) and FDA approved health claims. Nutrition labeling is required for all foods with a nutrient content claim or health claim. All food products marketed after May 1994 must bear nutritional labeling unless the food qualifies for an exemption.</p>

<p>Labeling regulations and exemptions can be found in <a title="21 Code of Federal Regulations-Part 101" href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_06/21cfr101_06.html">21 Code of Federal Regulations-Part 101</a>.</p>
<p>For more information on Nutrition Labeling:<br>Visit the <a title="U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition" href="http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofFoods/CFSAN/">U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition</a> Web site. </p>
<p>Labeling agreements can be made if the product needs to be further processed, labeled or repacked in order for a label agreement to qualify; i.e. the product can’t be sent to a customer who serves it “as is” such as tortilla chips.  Bread made into sandwiches would qualify for example.  Please see <a title="21 CFR 100.100" href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=100.100">21 CFR 100.100</a> (d) through (e) for the regulations describing labeling agreements.</p>
