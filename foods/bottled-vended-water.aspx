	<h2>State of Texas Eliminates Licensing and Regulation of Seven Occupations/Businesses</h2>
	<br>
	<p>A new state law, Senate Bill 202, was recently passed by the Texas Legislature.  The new law becomes effective September 1, 2015.  State law will no longer require a license issued by the Department of State Health Services (DSHS) for the following businesses and occupations: </p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Rendering businesses</li>
		<li>Contact lens dispensers</li>
		<li>Opticians</li>
		<li>Bedding</li>
		<li>Tanning facilities</li>
		<li>Personal emergency response providers</li>
		<li>Bottled and vended water certificates of competency</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>On and after July 1, 2015, DSHS will not issue new licenses or renew expiring licenses for these programs. </p>
