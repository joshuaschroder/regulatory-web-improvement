<p>Texas is a major commercial supplier of seafood products. It is essential for both industry and consumers that the seafood be harvested, processed, and distributed safely. </p>
<p>To reduce illness from seafood, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adopted regulations (<a title="Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 123" href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=123&amp;showFR=1">Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 123</a>) effective December 18, 1997. The regulations require all processors to implement HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) systems to prevent, eliminate, or reduce seafood safety hazards to an acceptable level.</p>
<p>Successful implementation of HACCP requires training of both industry and regulators. HACCP training is available from various associations, private consultants, and the Seafood Alliance. The Seafood Alliance includes representatives from Sea Grant, National Fisheries Institute, National Food Processors Association, National Marine Fisheries Institute, Interstate Shellfish Shippers Conference, FDA, and the Association of Food and Drug&nbsp;Officials&nbsp;(AFDO). </p>
<p>The three day course offered by the Seafood Alliance is recognized in the regulation as meeting training requirements.</p>
<p>There is now an internet course called <a title="Seafood HACCP Alliance Internet Training Course" href="http://seafoodhaccp.cornell.edu/Intro/index.html">Seafood HACCP Alliance Internet Training Course</a> that covers the first two-days of the three-day course. In order to complete the training, however, a one-day face-to-face training course, called Segment II, must be taken. For more information on the three-day course, the two-day internet course, and the one-day Segment II course, visit the <a title="AFDO Web site" href="http://www.afdo.org/">AFDO Web site</a>. </p>
