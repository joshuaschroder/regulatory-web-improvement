<h3>Reportable Food Registry (RFR) Requirement </h3>
<p>The RFR was established by section 1005 of the Food And Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-085) to provide a reliable mechanism to track patterns of adulteration in food in order to support efforts by FDA to target limited inspection resources to protect the public health. The RFR covers all foods regulated by FDA except infant formula and dietary supplements. The RFR requires a responsible party to file a report through the RFR electronic portal when there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. Such foods are “Reportable Foods.” “Responsible Party” is defined as the person who submits the registration information to FDA for a food Facility that manufactures, processes, packs or holds food for human or animal consumption in the United States. Federal, state and local public health officials may also use the portal to report information that may come to them about reportable foods. As of May 24, 2010, the RFR electronic portal became part of the Department of Human Services’ Safety Reporting Portal.</p>
