<p>The state (DSHS) stopped administering the Certified Food Manger (CFM) exam on January 7th 2010. Individuals testing after that date would have taken the CFM exam through one of the online or national exam providers and DSHS does not keep these records. Please contact testing providers directly for information regarding their certificates.</p>

<p>Examinations offered through training programs and test sites are accredited through American National Standards Institute – Conference for Food Protection (ANSI-CFP). Certified Food Manager Certificates issued through these providers receive national reciprocity.</p>

<p>Food establishments permitted by a local health jurisdiction should contact that specific jurisdiction to obtain information regarding their requirements for food manager certification.</p>
