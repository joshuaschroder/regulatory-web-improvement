<p>The Texas Department of State Health Services, Certified Food Manager (CFM) Program has been accrediting food manager training courses since 1988. Today, food manager training and certification has become a standard of the food industry as well as a regulatory standard throughout the state of Texas.</p>
<p>The CFM Program accredits and licenses training programs for candidates new to the food industry who may need training. The Program also licenses Test Sites that provide the food manager's examination to those who have sufficient background in the food industry and wish to take the exam with minimal or no training. Examinations offered through training programs and test sites are accredited through American National Standards Institute â€“ Conference for Food Protection (ANSI-CFP). Certified Food Manager Certificates issued through these providers receive national reciprocity. The CFM Program also licenses online exam providers. Certified Food Manager Certificates issued through these providers receive state-wide reciprocity.</p>
<p>The Texas Department of State Health Services, Certified Food Manager Program remains dedicated to the health and safety of the citizens of the state, educating food service employees in the principles of food safety to produce safe food products for Texas consumers.</p>
