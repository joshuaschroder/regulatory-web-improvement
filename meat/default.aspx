<p>The Meat Safety Assurance Unit partners with the people, communities, and meat and poultry industries to protect, promote and improve health. We accomplish our mission by regulating and enforcing public health laws and policies necessary to prevent disease and protect the public's well being. These efforts assure the citizens of the state that products bearing the Texas mark of inspection are produced from healthy animals that are slaughtered humanely and prepared in a sanitary manner, contain no harmful ingredients, and are truthfully labeled.</p>
