<h2>Inspection Requirements</h2>
<p>An individual who contemplates engaging in a business of slaughtering livestock and/or processing of meat or poultry or meat or poultry food products should furnish information relative to the nature and volume of the operations to the <a title="Contact Meat Safety Assurance Unit" href="/meat/contact.aspx">Meat Safety Assurance (MSA) Unit</a>.

<h2>Grants of Inspection</h2>
<p>The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) issues three different Grants of Inspection. A Grant of Inspection is an authorization from DSHS to engage in a meat or poultry related business.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><a title="Grant of Inspection" href="/meat/grants/inspection.aspx">Grants of Inspection</a></strong>, sometimes referred to as full inspections, are required for operations that slaughter and/or process livestock for intrastate commerce.<br/><br/></li>
	<li><strong><a title="Grant of Custom Exemption" href="/meat/grants/custom-exemption.aspx">Grants of Custom Exemption</a></strong> are required of individuals and businesses that slaughter and/or process livestock for the owner of the livestock, or for the personal use of the owner.<br/><br/></li>
	<li><strong><a title="Grant of Poultry/Rabbit Exemption" href="/meat/grants/poultry-rabbit-exemption.aspx">Grants of Poultry/Rabbit Exemption</a></strong> may be issued to individuals who produce low volumes of poultry or rabbits and wish to slaughter and process them for sale. Poultry and rabbit producers and processors are required to either obtain an exemption or a Grant of Inspection.<br/><br/></li>
</ul>
