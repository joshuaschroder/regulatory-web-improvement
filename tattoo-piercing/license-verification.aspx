<h2>Return of Completed License Verification Requests</h2>
<p>All completed license verification requests will be returned via 1st Class mail. </p>
<p>
	<strong>Overnight mail</strong><br/>
	The License Verification group can return overnight mail using only FedEx® or Lonestar Overnight. An account number must be provided unless a pre-paid return envelope is included with the request. UPS will no longer pick up packages from the physical location, so no documents can be returned via UPS. 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Fax or email</strong><br/>
	We can fax or email the completed form, but most states will not accept a completed license verification without an original signature or an imprinted state seal.
