<h2>CDC and FDA Investigation of Infections Associated with Tattooing</h2>
<p><strong>Date Posted:</strong> March 7, 2012<br/></p>
<p>Dear Tattoo Studio Operator: </p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are investigating a cluster of skin infections among persons who received tattoos from May 2011 through February 2012. These particular infections usually appear between 1–3 weeks after tattooing. To date, all reported infections have involved clients who have received new tattoos with a commercially available tattoo ink. </p>
<p>If you have a client who reports having a skin infection after receiving a tattoo within the last 10 months (after April 2011), please ask that person to report it to their local health department and see a doctor for diagnosis of the organism causing the infection. Additionally, you are reminded that all tattoo studios must provide a written report to the Texas Department of State Health Services, Drugs and Medical Devices Group (DMDG), of any infection and/or allergic reaction resulting from the application of a tattoo. For instructions on reporting an infection or allergic reaction to DMDG, please refer to the <a title="Report of Infection or Allergic Reaction by a Tattoo or Body Piercing Studio" href="http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&amp;ItemID=8589964343">Report of Infection or Allergic Reaction by a Tattoo or Body Piercing Studio</a> (revised form DMDG – 118).</p>
<p>If you have questions or require additional assistance regarding this notice, please contact us by phone at (512) 834-6755 or visit the DMDG website at: www.dshs.state.tx.us/dmd. Your cooperation in this investigation is very important for the protection of your clients. Thanks for your help.</p>
