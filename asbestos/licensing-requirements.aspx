<h2>Who Must be Licensed?</h2>
<p>Anyone engaged in asbestos-related activities in a public building in the state of Texas, must be appropriately licensed or registered by the Department of State Health Services (DSHS). Licenses are required to perform asbestos-related work in public buildings in Texas for contractors, supervisors, workers, consultants, management planners, inspectors, air monitors, laboratories, transporters, and training providers.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Obtaining a License</h2>
<p>Many asbestos licenses are now available online, using the Regulatory Services Online Licensing System. Please see the <a title="online licensing page" href="/asbestos/online-licensing.aspx">online licensing page</a> to determine if you may apply or renew online.</p> 
<p>If your license type is not eligible for online application/renewal, please see the <a title="applications and forms page" href="/asbestos/forms.aspx">applications and forms page</a> for more information on completing a standard application packet.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Processing Time</h2>
<p>In recent months, there has been a large quantity of new and renewal applications, and you can expect it to take at least five (5) to six (6) weeks for us to issue a license, if all required documentation is submitted and is accurate.</p>

<p>Please help us help you maintain current licensure. Processing your license is our top priority. Phone calls do not help us complete your application, it only slows the process by shifting the priority to handling the calls. Please keep your calls to a minimum so that we can concentrate on our top priority. You!</p>

<p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Licensing Exemptions</h2>
<p>One exception to this requirement is that of a person who removes resilient floor covering materials in public buildings.</p> 
<p>However, this exemption applies only if the person doing the removal has been trained in the 8 hour course provided by the <a title="Resilient Floor Covering Institute" href="http://www.rfci.com/">Resilient Floor Covering Institute</a>, (301) 340-8580. Also, this exemption is strictly limited to flooring materials maintained in a non-friable state.</p>
<p>All out-of-state applicants must comply with all licensing requirements that would be imposed on a Texas resident seeking licensure in the out-of-state person's base state.</p>
