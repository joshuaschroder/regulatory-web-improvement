<h2>Who is Required to License?</h2>
<p>Anyone engaged in asbestos-related activities in a public building in the state of Texas, must be appropriately licensed or registered by the Department of State Health Services (DSHS). One exception to this requirement is that of a person who removes resilient floor covering materials in public buildings. However, this exemption applies only if the person doing the removal has been trained in the 8 hour course provided by the <a title="Resilient Floor Covering Institute" href="http://www.rfci.com/">Resilient Floor Covering Institute</a>, (301) 340-8580. Also, this exemption is strictly limited to flooring materials maintained in a non-friable state. All out-of-state applicants must comply with all licensing requirements that would be imposed on a Texas resident seeking licensure in the out-of-state person's base state.</p>

<h2>Online Licensing</h2>
<p>Certain license types may apply or renew online using the <a title="Regulatory Services Online Licensing System" href="https://vo.ras.dshs.state.tx.us/">Regulatory Services Online Licensing System</a>. If your license type is not listed below, you will need to renew by mail. </p>

<h3>Renewing by Mail</h3>

<h3>How Long Does It Take to Renew a License?</h3>
<p>Applications are processed in the order which they are received. Expect a license renewal to take at least five (5) to six (6) weeks from the time that we receive the application for us to issue a license. If the application is incomplete or inaccurate, additional time may be required.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please refrain from calling to check the status of your application unless an inordinate amount of time has passed. Phone calls do not help us complete your application; it only slows the process by shifting the priority from processing applications to handling calls.</p>
