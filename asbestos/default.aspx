<p>The mission of the Asbestos Program is to protect and promote the physical and environmental health of the people of Texas from asbestos. We strive to prevent unnecessary exposure of the public to asbestos in workplaces and buildings and to assure proper disposal of asbestos. Through our Outreach Program we educate the public to gain voluntary compliance with state and federal asbestos law. We carry out our mission efficiently, effectively, fairly and professionally with respect and dedication to all Texans.</p>
