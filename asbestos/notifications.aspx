<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Regulations require that notification be made to the Department of State Health Services before beginning renovation projects which include the disturbance of any asbestos-containing material (ACM) in a building or facility or before the demolition of a building or facility, <strong><em>even when no asbestos is present</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The notification must be made whether you are notifying in accordance with NESHAP, TAHPR, or both. The department shall be notified using the <a title="Online Asbestos Notification System" href="https://vo.ras.dshs.state.tx.us/datamart/login.do">Online Asbestos Notification System</a> or by mailing the <a title="Asbestos Abatement/Demolition Notification Form" href="/asbestos/forms.aspx#notification">Asbestos Abatement/Demolition Notification Form</a> to the department. Notification shall be made no less than 10 working days (not calendar days) prior to the start of demolition or asbestos abatement activity or any other activity that will disturb asbestos (except for emergencies or ordered demolitions). Notifications which do not meet the 10-day requirement or are incomplete are considered to be "improper" and may result in enforcement proceedings.</p>

<p>In addition, a courtesy copy of all amendments should be faxed or emailed to your <a title="Asbestos Regional Inspector List" href="/asbestos/inspectors.aspx">regional inspector</a>.</p>
