<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Regulations require that written notification be submitted to the Department of State Health Services before beginning renovation projects which include the disturbance of any asbestos-containing material (ACM) in a building or facility or before the demolition of a building or facility, <strong><em>even when no asbestos is present</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The <a title="Demolition/Renovation form" href="/asbestos/forms.aspx#notification">Demolition/Renovation form</a> must be used whether you are notifying in accordance with NESHAP, TAHPR, or both. The notification form must be postmarked at least 10 working days (not calendar days) prior to the project start date (except for emergencies or ordered demolitions). Notifications which do not meet the 10-day requirement or are incomplete are considered to be "improper" and may result in enforcement proceedings. If an item on the form is not applicable to the project in question, you must write "N.A." in that space.</p>

<p>In addition, a copy of this form must be provided to your regional inspector prior to the start of your project -- <a title="Asbestos Regional and Local Inspectors List" href="/asbestos/inspectors.aspx">Asbestos Regional and Local Inspectors List</a>.</p>
