<p>The Drugs and Medical Devices Group  is responsible for ensuring that cosmetics are properly labeled and do not contain harmful additives. We also ensure that the manufacturers and distributors of cosmetics do not make unsubstantiated or fraudulent claims about their products.  In order to accomplish this objective, inspections of these facilities are conducted on an as needed basis.  In addition, the Group provides technical assistance to manufacturers and distributors, answers inquiries from consumers and investigates complaints involving possible violations of the state requirements for cosmetic products.</p>
