<p>There are two categories, listed below, of radioactive material that require the submission of an application for the possession of radioactive material for use under a general license acknowledgement (GLA). The general license is granted by <a title="Title 25 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) ยง289.251(g)" href="/radiation_OLD/laws-rules.aspx#289251">Title 25 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) ยง289.251(g)</a>.</p>

<h2>1. Certain Detecting, Measuring, Gauging, or Controlling Devices</h2>
<p>These devices are designed and manufactured for the purpose of detecting, measuring, gauging or controlling thickness, density, level, interface location, radiation, leakage, or qualitative or quantitative chemical composition.</p>
<p>This category involves devices that contain radioactive material in the following quantities:</p>
<ul>
	<li>10 millicuries(mCi) or greater of cesium-137; </li>
	<li>1 mCi or greater of cobalt-60; </li>
	<li>1 mCi or greater of americium-241 or any other transuranic (e.g. curium-244, californium-251); or </li>
	<li>0.1 mCi of strontium-90. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Application Process</h3>
<p>To apply for a GLA for these devices, an <a title="Application for a General License Acknowledgement (RC Form 251-2)" href="/radiation_OLD/forms.aspx#2512">Application for a General License Acknowledgement (RC Form 251-2)</a> and <a title="Business Information Form (RC Form 252-1)" href="/radiation_OLD/forms.aspx#2521">Business Information Form (RC Form 252-1)</a> must be completed and submitted, along with the appropriate fee, within 30 days of receipt of the device.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>2. In Vitro Clinical or Laboratory Testing</h2>
<p>The second category involves radioactive material that is used for <em>in vitro</em> clinical or laboratory testing specified in <a title="25 TAC 289.251(f)(4)(G)" href="/radiation_OLD/laws-rules.aspx#289251">25 TAC 289.251(f)(4)(G)</a>.</p>

<h3>Application Process</h3>
<p>To apply for a GLA for <em>in vitro</em> use, an <a title="Application for Acknowledgement to use the General License for in vitro Clinical or Laboratory Testing (RC Form 251-1)" href="/radiation_OLD/forms.aspx#2511">Application for Acknowledgement to use the General License for <em>in vitro</em> Clinical or Laboratory Testing (RC Form 251-1)</a> and <a title="Business Information Form (RC Form 252-1)" href="/radiation_OLD/forms.aspx#2521">Business Information Form (RC Form 252-1)</a> must be completed and submitted along with the appropriate fee. The GLA must be issued to your facility before the radioactive material can be possessed. </p>
