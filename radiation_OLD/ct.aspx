<p>As part of our ongoing mission to ensure health and safety, the Texas Department of State Health Services, Radiation Control Program is bringing information regarding excess radiation exposure during brain perfusion Computed Tomography (CT) imaging to your attention.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing investigation by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA), of cases of excess radiation exposure during brain perfusion CT imaging. The investigation has identified over 250 patients who were exposed to excess radiation as much as eight times the expected level during their CT perfusion scans. The FDA has also received reports of possible excess radiation exposure from CT scans in other states. At this time, no cases have been reported in Texas. The reported cases do involve more than one manufacturer of CT scanners.</p>
<p>Based on this investigation, the Department of State Health Services is making two requests of all CT facilities in Texas. First, we are requesting that facilities conduct an internal review of their CT protocols to ensure they are correct and are the intended protocol for the examination to be conducted, and second, implement as appropriate, the recommendations of the position statement from the <a title="Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors, Inc. (CRCPD)" href="https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/radiation/pdffiles/CRCPD_CT.pdf">Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors, Inc. (CRCPD)</a> <span class="small">(PDF, 44KB)</span>.</p>
<p>Additional information on the FDA investigation may be found on the FDA Web site under, "<a title="Safety Investigation of CT Brain Perfusion Scans: Update 11/9/2010" href="http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm185898.htm">Safety Investigation of CT Brain Perfusion Scans: Update 11/9/2010</a>."</p>
