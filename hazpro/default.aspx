<p>The Hazardous Consumer Products Registration program, under the Texas Hazardous Substances Act, handles compliance over a broad range of commonly used consumer items including automotive products; household cleaners; polishes and waxes; paints and glues; infant items; children's toys; and sleep wear. This responsibility is implemented through registration of manufacturers; re-packagers and/or importers of hazardous substances; enforcement of labeling regulation, including hazard warning statements and first aid instructions appropriate for the specific product; and detention of recalled, mislabeled, and banned items.</p>
