<br/>
<h2>Toys At All Ages</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Read warning labels for age recommendations. Even the brightest child should not be given a toy labelled specifically for an older child. Toys meant for older children may have parts or strings that can choke or strangle a younger child. </li>
	<li>Always give a safety helmet with the gift of a bicycle. Bicycles are associated with about 300 deaths and 400,000 injuries annually to children under age 15. Helmets decrease the risk of death and severe injury. </li>
	<li>Buy the appropriate protective gear to complement all gifts of sporting equipment. For example, if you give a gift of in-line skates, be sure to buy a helmet and wrist, elbow, knee, and shin pads. </li>
</ul>

<hr/>
<h2>Infants</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Never buy toys with cords and strings that can become wrapped around an infant's neck. </li>
	<li>Buy large rattles, teethers, and squeeze toys that cannot get lodged in an infant's throat. </li>
</ul>

<hr/>
<h2>Children Under Age 3</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Do not buy toys with small parts for children under 3 years old. This includes marbles, small balls and balloons, which can choke a young child. </li>
	<li>Use caution when giving toys to older children who have siblings under age 3. Younger children often are injured by toys that are meant for their older siblings. </li>
	<li>Buy toys made of sturdy construction with tightly-secured eyes, noses and other small parts. </li>
</ul>

<hr/>
<h2>Children Under Age 8</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Do not buy toys with sharp points or metal edges. </li>
	<li>Do not buy electrical toys with heating elements. </li>
	<li>Avoid buying toy guns that look like and can be mistaken for real guns. Some cap guns can injure a child's hearing. </li>
	<li>If you buy arrows or darts (not recommended for children under age 5), make sure they have rubber suction cups or flexible, protective tips that stay secured when used. </li>
	<li>Do not buy balloons for children under age 8. Uninflated balloons and broken pieces can choke a child. </li>
</ul>
