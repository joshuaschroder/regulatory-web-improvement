	<li>Complete and mail the application for an EMS Provider License, all the required documents and any applicable fees.</li>
	<li>The EMS Certification and Licensing Group will e-mail a confirmation letter assigning a licensing specialist to assist you through the application process.</li>
	<li>Your agencies protocols; equipment, supply and medication list; quality assurance plan; and policy and procedures will be assigned to an EMS Compliance Group Field Office and you will be e-mailed a confirmation letter assigning a compliance specialist to conduct your survey and inspection.</li>
	<li>You will work with each group to clear any deficiencies.</li>

	<li>After the inspection/survey your results will be sent to your licensing specialist. Remember, you are not considered licensed at this point in the process.</li>
