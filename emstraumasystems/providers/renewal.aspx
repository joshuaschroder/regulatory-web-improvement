<h2>1. Renewal Process</h2>

<p>If you need to pay by regular check or money order, please choose the pay later option and submit your application, then mail your payment with your supplemental information. You must submit supplemental information on a disc or USB flash drive by mail to complete the renewal process. DSHS can not complete your renewal with out the supplemental information.
