<h2>Are the EMS provider surveys new?</h2>
<p>No, DSHS (department) has been conducting these surveys for many years.  The survey has been known by many different names throughout the years – Renewal Survey, Responsibility Survey, Site-Survey, Compliance Survey, etc. but the overall process has remained the same.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Why does DSHS conduct EMS provider surveys?</h2>
<p>The department conducts EMS Provider surveys to ensure that the EMS Provider is in compliance with all the different aspects of the <a title="Texas Administrative Code &#0167;157.11" href="http://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=R&app=9&p_dir=&p_rloc=&p_tloc=&p_ploc=&pg=1&p_tac=&ti=25&pt=1&ch=157&rl=11">Texas Administrative Code &#0167;157.11</a>.  The survey process allows the Administrator of Record (AOR) and all other administrative and supervisory staff to do a comprehensive “self-study” of their service and become familiar with all the licensing requirements and responsibilities of an EMS Provider.  This survey process also serves as a way for the DSHS EMS Specialist to get to know and understand how each unique EMS Provider operates.  The department strongly recommends that the AOR and the medical director participate and attend the surveys. Rule 157.11 (m) establishes the minimum standards an EMS Provider must meet to be in compliance.  Depending on the EMS Provider, certain policies and procedures may be adopted, implemented and enforced, and those policies and procedures, in addition to the rules, are what the department will survey to and hold the EMS Provider accountable for.  The department will not survey for “best practices.”</p>

<hr/>
<h2>How will we know when it’s time for our survey?</h2>
<p>While the department has authority to conduct unannounced surveys, at this time most surveys will be announced approximately 30 days in advance.  An EMS Specialist will send the EMS Provider a notice advising of the upcoming survey along with a copy of the Compliance Survey Checklist and Questionnaire so that the EMS Provider can start preparing by doing their own “self-survey”.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Do we have to wait until its time for our survey before we can begin preparing?</h2>
<p>The department encourages each EMS Provider to be familiar with all the requirements and responsibilities of <a title="TAC Rule 157.11" href="http://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=R&app=9&p_dir=&p_rloc=&p_tloc=&p_ploc=&pg=1&p_tac=&ti=25&pt=1&ch=157&rl=11">TAC Rule 157.11</a>.  You can start working on your “self-survey” and find opportunities for improvement and address any issues identified by using the Compliance Survey Checklist and Questionnaire, which may be found on the <a title="EMS Providers applications and forms page" href="/emstraumasystems/providers/forms.aspx">EMS Providers applications and forms page</a>. </p>

<hr/>
<h2>What are some of the most common survey deficiencies that the department finds?</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Lack of a quality assurance plan that addresses the minimums as per <a title="TAC Rule 157.11 (m) (2) (A-G)" href="http://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=R&app=9&p_dir=&p_rloc=&p_tloc=&p_ploc=&pg=1&p_tac=&ti=25&pt=1&ch=157&rl=11">TAC Rule 157.11 (m) (2) (A-G)</a> or a quality assurance plan exists but is not being utilized or documented.</li>
	<li>No documentation of the EMS provider’s anaphylaxis training</li>
	<li>Pharmaceutical storage not in compliance with manufacturer’s and/or FDA recommendations</li>
	<li>No documentation in regards to crew member orientation and internship period.</li>
	<li>EMS Provider is not assuring that data is being reported to the EMS &amp; Trauma Registries.</li>
</ol>

<hr/>
<h2>So what happens when deficiencies are found?</h2>
<p>Upon completion of the survey, an EMS Specialist will have an exit conference with the AOR and discuss any preliminary findings. The Specialist will then discuss the preliminary findings with the Group Manager and a results letter will be sent to the EMS Provider within 5 business days.  If any deficiencies need to be corrected, a Survey Notice will also be sent that further explains the requirements for the EMS Provider to submit an acceptable Plan of Correction.  Upon the receipt by the department of the EMS Provider’s Plan of Correction or anytime thereafter, the department may conduct a follow-up survey to validate or confirm the corrections were made.   The plan of correction process will be the usual procedure utilized should the survey identify non-compliance; however, a failure to promptly correct, serious or repeat non-compliance may result in DSHS considering state enforcement action.</p>
