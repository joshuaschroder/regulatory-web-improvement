<p>To inform the public of possible contamination of fish and shellfish caught by recreational fishermen in the state, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) issues <a title="news releases" href="/seafood/news.aspx">news releases</a> regarding fish consumption advisories and fish consumption bans. Eating fish from an area with a consumption advisory is not illegal, but people should not eat more fish than the amount listed in the advisory. In instances where a serious or imminent threat to public health exists, DSHS may prohibit the taking of fish and shellfish from an area. Taking fish from a closed area where a fish consumption ban is in effect is a violation of state law, enforced by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.</p>

<h2>Testing of Water Bodies</h2>
<p>Fish and shellfish in several Texas water bodies contain contaminants at levels that, if consumed, may pose a threat to human health. The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) tests fish and shellfish tissues from Texas public water bodies for contaminants and informs the public of contamination in fish and shellfish by issuing marine orders, possession bans (closures), and consumption advisories. However, DSHS does not routinely test fish and shellfish tissues in every Texas public water body for contaminants, nor has DSHS tested fish and shellfish tissues from every public water body in Texas. DSHS tests fish and shellfish tissues from Texas public water bodies as resources allow.</p>

<h2>Risks of Consuming Shellfish</h2>
<p>Molluscan shellfish defined as oysters, clams, and mussels pose risks that are different from fish and crabs. Because molluscan shellfish are filter feeders and often eaten raw, a program has been developed to protect consumers. Molluscan shellfish harvest areas are classified on <a title="shellfish harvest maps" href="/seafood/shellfish-harvest-maps.aspx">shellfish harvest maps</a>. These maps indicate areas that are approved, conditionally approved, restricted, or prohibited for harvest. Approved and conditionally approved harvest areas open or close based on rainfall, river flow, bacteriological results, presence of biotoxins (e.g. red tide), or illness investigations linked to a harvest area. The opening or closing of approved and conditionally approved harvest areas is directed by DSHS through issuance of a marine order. Restricted and prohibited areas are classified as such based on levels of fecal pollution, human pathogens, or contaminants. DSHS issues a marine order to classify areas as restricted or prohibited. Before harvesting molluscan shellfish individuals should have a current shellfish classification map and determine the status of the approved and conditionally approved harvest areas. You may go to our <a title="classification map page" href="/seafood/shellfish-harvest-maps.aspx">classification map page</a> to see the most current maps or call 512-834-6757. DSHS maintains a 24-hour toll-free phone number (1-800-685-0361) to determine status of approved and conditionally approved harvest areas.</p>

<h2>Consumption Advisories and Possession Bans</h2>
<p>A possession ban prohibits the taking of fish or crabs from a water body where tissue testing indicates the likelihood of a serious or imminent threat to public health. Harvesting fish or crabs from a banned area is a violation of state law enforceable by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. A fish or crab consumption advisory issued by DSHS recommends limited consumption of fish or crabs from a water body because tests found contaminants in fish or crab tissue at unsafe levels. Eating more fish or crabs than recommended by a consumption advisory may pose a potential human health risk, but harvesting fish or crabs from a water body with a consumption advisory is not illegal. DSHS periodically tests fish and crabs from water bodies with consumption advisories or bans to reevaluate the extent of contamination in fish and crab tissues and study trends.</p>
