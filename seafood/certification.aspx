<h2>Texas Shellfish</h2>
<p> A Texas <a href="/seafood/forms.aspx" title="Shellfish Certificate of Compliance">Shellfish Certificate of Compliance</a> is required by any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity that buys molluscan shellfish (oysters, clams, or mussels) from a harvester and ships them in the shell, or shucks and packs them, or repacks molluscan shellfish (either shucked or in the shell) in the State of Texas. All certified shellfish shippers are listed in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) publication <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/FederalStateFoodPrograms/ucm2006753.htm" title="Interstate Certified Shellfish Shippers List"> Interstate Certified Shellfish Shippers List </a> </p>

<h2>Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) Training</h2>
<p>Texas is a major commercial supplier of molluscan shellfish products. It is essential for both industry and consumers that molluscan shellfish be harvested, processed, and distributed safely. </p>
<p>To reduce illness from molluscan shellfish and other seafood products, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adopted regulations (<a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=123&amp;showFR=1" title="Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 123">Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 123</a>) effective December 18, 1997. The regulations require all processors to implement HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) systems to prevent, eliminate, or reduce seafood safety hazards to an acceptable level. </p> 
<p>Successful implementation of HACCP requires training of both industry and regulators. HACCP training is available from various associations, private consultants, and the Seafood Alliance. The Seafood Alliance includes representatives from Sea Grant, National Fisheries Institute, National Food Processors Association, National Marine Fisheries Institute, Interstate Shellfish Shippers Conference, FDA, and the Association of Food and Drug Officials (AFDO). </p>
<p>The three day course offered by the Seafood Alliance is recognized in the regulation as meeting training requirements.</p>
<p>There is now an internet course called <a href="http://seafoodhaccp.cornell.edu/Intro/index.html" title="Seafood HACCP Alliance Internet Training Course"> Seafood HACCP Alliance Internet Training Course </a> that covers the first two-days of the three-day course. In order to complete the training, however, a one-day face-to-face training course, called Segment II, must be taken. For more information on the three-day course, the two-day internet course, and the one-day Segment II course, visits the    <a href="http://www.afdo.org/" title="AFDO Web site">AFDO Web site</a>. </p>
