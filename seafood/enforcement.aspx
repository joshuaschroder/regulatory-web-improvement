<p>Disciplinary actions are taken by regulatory authorities in response to a violation of the law or rules. Different kinds of actions may be taken depending on the severity of the offense, the history of previous violations, efforts made to correct the violation, the harm to the victims, the likelihood of a repeat violation, and other matters related to each particular case. These actions are taken to protect and promote the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Texas.</p>
