<p>Turtles can bioaccumulate contaminants at levels that could be a potential human health concern. Turtles accumulate contaminants in their fat, organs, and skin. Therefore, if you choose to eat turtles caught from Texas waters, the Texas Department of State Health Services recommends removing and discarding skin, all fat, eggs, and all organs to reduce the risk of exposure to contaminants. Save only the muscle meat from the legs and tail for eating. </p>
