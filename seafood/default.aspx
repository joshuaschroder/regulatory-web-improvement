</ul>

<h2>Other Resources</h2>

<p><a title="Local and county health departments" href="https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/regions/lhds.shtm">Local and county health departments</a> are typically the first source of information for licensing and certification of seafood related activities within their jurisdictions. We recommend contacting these entities before contacting the DSHS Foods Group or Retail Food Establishments Group (listed below). When a county or municipality does not have a health department, the Texas Department of State Health Services has jurisdiction over these areas.</p>


<p>The <a title="DSHS Foods Group" href="/foods/">DSHS Foods Group</a> is responsible for licensing of seafood wholesalers, seafood repackaging or relabeling, seafood processing (other than crab meat), and packaged food intended for customer self-service.</p>

<p>The <a title="DSHS Retail Food Establishments Group" href="/foodestablishments/">DSHS Retail Food Establishments Group</a> is responsible for permitting of restaurants, retail food stores, mobile food vendors, bed and breakfasts, catered food, vending machines, take out services, and food delivery services.</p>
