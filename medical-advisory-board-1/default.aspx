<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The mission of the Medical Advisory Board is to help reduce traffic deaths, disability and injury by evaluating medical histories, providing medical opinions and making recommendations to the Department of Public Safety (DPS) regarding the medical limitations of referred driver licensees and candidates and concealed handgun licensees and candidates.</p>

<h3>Drivers Licenses</h3>
<p>The Texas Department of State Health Services advises the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) in the licensing of persons having medical limitations which might adversely affect driving. This is now mandated under <a title="Health and Safety Code, Title 2 - Subtitle A, Chapter 12, SubChapter H" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/HS/htm/HS.12.htm">Health and Safety Code, Title 2 - Subtitle A, Chapter 12, SubChapter H</a>.</p>
<p>If law enforcement officers have cause for concern, they may report an individual to DPS for a medical evaluation referral.</p>

<h3>Concealed Handgun Licensing (CHL)</h3>
<p>The Medical Advisory Board has been directed to medically evaluate persons for eligibility for a license to carry a concealed handgun. For more information on laws and licensing requirements, please refer to the <a title="Texas DPS Concealed Handgun License page" href="https://www.txdps.state.tx.us/rsd/chl/">Texas DPS Concealed Handgun License page</a>.</p>

The release of such information by the physician to the board is an exception to the patient-physician privilege requirements of Section 5.08 of the Medical Practices Act.</p>
