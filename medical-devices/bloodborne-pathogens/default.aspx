<p>A list of registered needleless systems and sharps devices with engineered sharps injury protection is maintained by the Texas Department of State Health Services' (DSHS) Drugs and Medical Devices Group in order to assist state and local governments in implementing the bloodborne pathogen control provisions found in <a title="25 Texas Administrative Code, Sections 96.101 - 96.601" href="/medical-devices/bloodborne-pathogens/laws-rules.aspx">25 Texas Administrative Code, Sections 96.101 - 96.601</a>.</p>

<p>The devices included on this list are believed to be commercially available and as such shall have conformed to any applicable marketing clearance requirements established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and in effect at the time of their introduction into commerce. This list contains only those devices that are the subject of a registration application submitted to and reviewed by DSHS prior to inclusion on the list. Registration of a needleless system or a sharps device with engineered sharps injury protection is voluntary and does not constitute an endorsement or recommendation of such device by DSHS.</p>
