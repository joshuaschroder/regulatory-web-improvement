<h1>Documentation</h1>

<h2>Basic usage</h2>

<p>To check a URL like <a href="http://www.example.org/">http://www.example.org/</a>
it is enough to
type <code>linkchecker www.example.org</code> on the command line or
type <code>www.example.org</code> in the GUI application. This will check the
complete domain of <code>http://www.example.org</code> recursively. All links
pointing outside of the domain are also checked for validity.</p>

<p>Local files can also be checked. On Unix or OSX systems the syntax
is <code>file:///path/to/my/file.html</code>. On Windows the syntax is
<code>file://C|/path/to/my/file.html</code>. When directories are checked,
all included files will be checked.</p>

<p>On the GUI client the <code>Edit</code> menu has shortcuts for bookmark
files. For example if Google Chrome is installed, there will be
a menu entry called <code>Insert Google Chrome bookmark file</code> which
can be used to check all browser bookmarks.</p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<p>The commandline client options are documented
in the <a href="http://wummel.github.io/linkchecker/man1/linkchecker.1.html">linkchecker(1) manual page</a>.</p>

<p>In the GUI client, the following options are available:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Recursive depth</p>

<p>Check recursively all links up to given depth.
A negative depth (eg. <code>-1</code>) will enable infinite recursion.</p></li>
<li><p>Verbose output</p>

<p>If set, log all checked URLs. Default is to log only errors and warnings.</p></li>
<li><p>Debug</p>

<p>Prints debugging output in a separate window which can be seen with
<code>Help -&gt; Show debug</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Debug memory usage</p>

<p>Profiles memory usage and writes statistics and a dump file when checking
stops. The dump file can be examined with
<a href="https://github.com/wummel/linkchecker/blob/master/tests/analyze_memdump.py">external tools</a>.
This option should only be useful for developers.</p></li>
<li><p>Warning strings</p>

<p>Log a warning if any strings are found in the content of the checked
URL. Strings are entered one per line.</p>

<p>Use this to check for pages that contain some form of error, for example
"<code>This page has moved</code>" or "<code>Oracle Application error</code>".</p></li>
<li><p>Ignoring URLs</p>

<p>URLs matching the given regular expressions will be ignored and not checked.
Useful if certain URL types should not be checked like emails (ie.
"<code>^mailto:</code>").</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Configuration file</h2>

<p>Each user can edit a configuration with advanced options for
checking or filtering. The
<a href="http://wummel.github.io/linkchecker/man5/linkcheckerrc.5.html">linkcheckerrc(5) manual page</a>
documents all the options.</p>

<p>In the GUI client the configuration file can be edited directly from
the dialog <code>Edit -&gt; Options</code> and the clicking on <code>Edit</code>.</p>

<h2>Performed checks</h2>

<p>All URLs have to pass a preliminary syntax test.
After the syntax check passes, the URL is queued for connection
checking. All connection check types are described below.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>HTTP links (<code>http:</code>, <code>https:</code>)</p>

<p>After connecting to the given HTTP server the given path
or query is requested. All redirections are followed, and
if user/password is given it will be used as authorization
when necessary.
Permanently moved pages (status code 301) issue a warning.
All final HTTP status codes other than 2xx are errors.</p>

<p>For HTTPS links, the SSL certificate is checked against the
given hostname. If it does not match, a warnings is printed.</p></li>
<li><p>Local files (<code>file:</code>)</p>

<p>A regular, readable file that can be opened is valid. A readable
directory is also valid. All other files, for example unreadable,
non-existing or device files are errors.</p>

<p>File contents are checked for recursion. If they are parseable
files (for example HTML files), all links in that file will be
checked.</p></li>
<li><p>Mail links (<code>mailto:</code>)</p>

<p>A mailto: link resolves to a list of email addresses.
If one email address fails the whole list will fail.
For each email address the following things are checked:</p>

<ol>
<li>Check the address syntax, both the part before and after
the @ sign.</li>
<li>Look up the MX DNS records. If no MX record is found,
print an error.</li>
<li>Check if one of the MX mail hosts accept an SMTP connection.
Check hosts with higher priority first.
If none of the hosts accept SMTP, a warning is printed.</li>
<li>Try to verify the address with the VRFY command. If there is
an answer, the verified address is printed as an info.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>FTP links (<code>ftp:</code>)</p>

<p>For FTP links the following is checked:</p>

<ol>
<li>Connect to the specified host.</li>
<li>Try to login with the given user and password. The default
user is <code>anonymous</code>, the default password is <code>anonymous@</code>.</li>
<li>Try to change to the given directory.</li>
<li>List the file with the NLST command.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Telnet links (<code>telnet:</code>)</p>

<p>A connect and if user/password are given, login to the
given telnet server is tried.</p></li>
<li><p>NNTP links (<code>news:</code>, <code>snews:</code>, <code>nntp</code>)</p>

<p>A connect is tried to connect to the given NNTP server. If a news group or
article is specified, it will be requested from the server.</p></li>
<li><p>Unsupported links (<code>javascript:</code>, etc.)</p>

<p>An unsupported link will print a warning, but no error. No further checking
will be made.</p>

<p>The complete list of recognized, but unsupported links can be seen in the
<a href="https://github.com/wummel/linkchecker/blob/master/linkcheck/checker/unknownurl.py">unknownurl.py</a>
source file. The most prominent of them are JavaScript links.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Recursion</h2>

<p>Before descending recursively into a URL, it has to fulfill several
conditions. The conditions are checked in this order:</p>

<ol>
<li>The URL must be valid.</li>
<li>The URL must be parseable. This currently includes HTML files,
Bookmarks files (Opera, Chrome or Safari), directories and on
Windows systems MS Word files if Word and the Pywin32 module
is installed on your system.
If a file type cannot be determined (for example it does not have
a common HTML file extension, and the content does not look like
HTML), it is assumed to be non-parseable.</li>
<li>The URL content must be retrievable. This is usually the case
except for example mailto: or unknown URL types.</li>
<li>The maximum recursion level must not be exceeded. It is configured
with the <code>--recursion-level</code> command line option, the recursion
level GUI option, or through the configuration file.
The recursion level is unlimited by default.</li>
<li>It must not match the ignored URL list. This is controlled with
the <code>--ignore-url</code> command line option or through the
configuration file.</li>
<li>The Robots Exclusion Protocol must allow links in the URL to be
followed recursively. This is checked by evaluating the servers
robots.txt file and searching for a "nofollow" directive in the
HTML header data.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the local and FTP directory recursion reads all files in that
directory, not just a subset like <code>index.htm*</code>.</p>
