			<p style='text-indent:.5in;'>(f)  The department shall deny an application or renewal for listing or registering a family home or shall revoke a family home's listing or registration if the results of a background or criminal history check conducted by the department under Section 42.056 show that a person has been convicted of an offense under Title 5[<s>,</s>] or 6, Penal Code, or Chapter 43, Penal Code.</p>
