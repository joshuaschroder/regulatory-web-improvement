			<p style='text-indent:.5in;'>Sec. 94.007.  OPERATION OF VENDING FACILITIES <u>BY CERTAIN PERSONS WHO ARE NOT BLIND</u> [<s>UNDER THE REHABILITATION COMMISSION</s>].[<s>(a)</s>]If the <u>department</u> [<s>commission</s>] determines that a blind person could not properly operate a vending facility at a particular location, the <u>department</u> [<s>rehabilitation commission</s>] may survey the property to determine whether a [<s>handicapped</s>] person <u>with a</u> [<s>whose</s>] disability <u>that</u> is not of a visual nature could operate the facility in a proper manner.</p>
			<p style='text-indent:.5in;'>[<s>(b)  The commission and the rehabilitation commission may develop procedures and methods of exchanging information necessary to implement cooperative activities.</s></p>
			<p style='text-indent:.5in;'>[<s>(c)  The installation and operation of a vending facility by the rehabilitation commission must conform to the provisions of this chapter applicable to vending facilities installed by the commission.</s>]</p>

			<p style='text-indent:.5in;'>Sec. 94.009.  EMPLOYMENT OF ASSISTANTS.(a)If an individual licensed to operate a vending facility on state property requires an assistant, a qualified [<s>visually handicapped</s>] person <u>with a disability of a visual nature</u> must be given preference for employment.If the <u>department</u> [<s>commission</s>] determines that a [<s>visually handicapped</s>] person <u>with a disability of a visual nature</u> could not perform the labor for which an assistant is required, or if a [<s>visually handicapped</s>] person <u>with a disability of a visual nature</u> is not available, a [<s>handicapped</s>] person <u>with a</u> [<s>whose</s>] disability <u>that</u> is not of a visual nature must be given preference for employment.If no [<s>handicapped</s>] person <u>with a disability</u> is available for the job, preference must be given to a person who is socially, culturally, economically, or educationally disadvantaged.</p>
			<p style='text-indent:.5in;'>(b)  An assistant employed by a blind person licensed by the <u>department</u> [<s>commission</s>] must be approved by the <u>department</u> [<s>commission</s>], and the deliberate refusal of a blind licensee to comply with this section constitutes grounds for the revocation of his or her license.</p>
			<p style='text-indent:.5in;'>Sec. 94.010.  COMPETING VENDING MACHINES.(a)If the <u>department</u> [<s>commission</s>] and an agency agree to the installation and operation of an additional vending facility or vending machine on property that already has a <u>department-sponsored</u> [<s>commission-sponsored</s>] vending facility, no additional permit or license is required.However, the installation of a competing vending facility consisting of vending machines or other coin-operated devices must be authorized by the <u>department</u> [<s>commission</s>].The <u>department's</u> [<s>commission's</s>] authorization must be made with a view toward providing the greatest economic benefits for blind persons consonant with supplying the additional services required at the building.</p>
			<p style='text-indent:.5in;'>(b)  State agencies shall cooperate and negotiate in good faith to accomplish the purposes of this chapter.</p>
			<p style='text-indent:.5in;'>(c)  <u>Individuals with disabilities</u> [<s>Vocationally handicapped individuals</s>] who operate vending facilities on state property are entitled to receive all commissions from vending machines installed on the same property.If two or more vending facilities are operated by <u>individuals with disabilities</u> [<s>vocationally handicapped persons</s>] in a building in which vending machines are installed, the <u>department</u> [<s>commission</s>] shall divide the commissions from the vending machines among the [<s>handicapped</s>] operators <u>with disabilities</u> in a manner that will achieve equity and equality in the incomes of <u>those</u> [<s>the handicapped</s>] operators.If the <u>department has</u> [<s>commission and the rehabilitation commission have</s>] decided not to locate a vending facility in a building, the agency to whom a general permit has been issued shall determine the assignment of the commissions from vending machines installed in the building.</p>
			<p style='text-indent:.5in;'>Sec. 94.011.  VENDING FACILITY EQUIPMENT AND STOCK.(a)The <u>department</u> [<s>commission</s>] may supply a blind vending facility operator with equipment and initial stock necessary for the operator to begin business.</p>
			<p style='text-indent:.5in;'>(b)  The <u>department</u> [<s>commission</s>] shall collect and set aside from the proceeds of the operation of its vending facilities enough money:</p>
			<p style='text-indent:1.0in;'>(1)  to insure a sufficient amount of initial stock for the facilities and for their proper maintenance;</p>
			<p style='text-indent:1.0in;'>(2)  to pay the costs of supervision and other expenses incidental to the operation of the facilities; and</p>
			<p style='text-indent:1.0in;'>(3)  to pay other program costs to the extent necessary to assure fair and equal treatment of the blind persons licensed to operate the facilities and to the extent allowed under federal programs that provide financial support to the <u>department</u> [<s>commission</s>].</p>
			<p style='text-indent:.5in;'>(c)  Except for purchasing and installing original equipment, the operation of <u>department-sponsored</u> [<s>commission-sponsored</s>] vending facilities must be as self-supporting and self-sustaining as possible.To achieve this end, the <u>department</u> [<s>commission</s>] shall periodically review and, when necessary, revise its schedules for collecting and setting aside money from the proceeds of its vending facilities.</p>
			<p style='text-indent:.5in;'>Sec. 94.012.  DUTIES AND PRIVILEGES OF PARTIES.(a)The <u>executive commissioner</u> [<s>commission</s>] may promulgate rules and <u>the department may</u> initiate procedures necessary to implement this chapter.</p>

			<p style='text-indent:.5in;'>Sec. 94.014.  CONFORMITY WITH FEDERAL STATUTES.(a)This chapter shall be construed in a manner consistent with the requirements of federal programs that provide financial assistance to the <u>department</u> [<s>commission</s>].</p>
			<p style='text-indent:.5in;'>(b)  If a provision of this chapter conflicts with a federal program requirement, the <u>department</u> [<s>commission</s>] may waive or modify the provision to the extent necessary to secure the full benefits of the federal program.</p>
