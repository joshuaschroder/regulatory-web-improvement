			<h3>Sections 536.003(a), (b), (d), and (e), Government Code, are amended to read as follows:</h3>
			<p style='text-indent:.5in;'>(a)  The commission, in consultation with the advisory committee, shall develop quality-based outcome and process measures that promote the provision of efficient, quality health care and that can be used in the child health plan <u>program</u> and Medicaid [<s>programs</s>] to implement quality-based payments for acute care services and long-term services and supports across all delivery models and payment systems, including fee-for-service and managed care payment systems.  Subject to Subsection (a-1), the commission, in developing outcome and process measures under this section, must include measures that are based on potentially preventable events and that advance quality improvement and innovation.

			<p style='text-indent:1.0in;'>(1)  to promote continuous system reform, improved quality, and reduced costs; and</p>
			<p style='text-indent:1.0in;'>(2)  to account for managed care organizations added to a service area.</p>
			<p style='text-indent:.5in;'>(b)  To the extent feasible, the commission shall develop outcome and process measures:</p>
			<p style='text-indent:1.0in;'>(1)  consistently across all child health plan <u>program</u> and Medicaid [<s>program</s>] delivery models and payment systems;</p>
			<p style='text-indent:1.0in;'>(2)  in a manner that takes into account appropriate patient risk factors, including the burden of chronic illness on a patient and the severity of a patient's illness;</p>
			<p style='text-indent:1.0in;'>(3)  that will have the greatest effect on improving quality of care and the efficient use of services, including acute care services and long-term services and supports;</p>
			<p style='text-indent:1.0in;'>(4)  that are similar to outcome and process measures used in the private sector, as appropriate;</p>
			<p style='text-indent:1.0in;'>(5)  that reflect effective coordination of acute care services and long-term services and supports;</p>
			<p style='text-indent:1.0in;'>(6)  that can be tied to expenditures; and</p>
			<p style='text-indent:1.0in;'>(7)  that reduce preventable health care utilization and costs.</p>
			<p style='text-indent:.5in;'>(d)  The executive commissioner by rule may require managed care organizations and physicians and other health care providers participating in the child health plan <u>program</u> and Medicaid [<s>programs</s>] to report to the commission in a format specified by the executive commissioner information necessary to develop outcome and process measures under this section.</p>
			<p style='text-indent:.5in;'>(e)  If the commission increases physician and other health care provider reimbursement rates under the child health plan <u>program</u> or Medicaid [<s>program</s>] as a result of an increase in the amounts appropriated for the programs for a state fiscal biennium as compared to the preceding state fiscal biennium, the commission shall, to the extent permitted under federal law and to the extent otherwise possible considering other relevant factors, correlate the increased reimbursement rates with the quality-based outcome and process measures developed under this section.</p>

			<p style='text-indent:1.0in;'>(1)  align payment incentives with high-quality, cost-effective health care;</p>
			<p style='text-indent:1.0in;'>(2)  reward the use of evidence-based best practices;</p>
			<p style='text-indent:1.0in;'>(3)  promote the coordination of health care;</p>
			<p style='text-indent:1.0in;'>(4)  encourage appropriate physician and other health care provider collaboration;</p>
			<p style='text-indent:1.0in;'>(5)  promote effective health care delivery models; and</p>

			<p style='text-indent:1.0in;'>(2)  any existing performance-based payment system used under the Medicare program that meets the requirements of this chapter, modified as necessary to account for programmatic differences, if implementing the system would:</p>

			<p style='text-indent:1.5in;'>(B)  align quality-based payment incentives for physicians and other health care providers with the Medicare program; and</p>
			<p style='text-indent:1.0in;'>(3)  alternative payment methodologies within the system that are used in the Medicare program, modified as necessary to account for programmatic differences, and that will achieve cost savings and improve quality of care in the child health plan <u>program</u> and Medicaid [<s>programs</s>].</p>
			<p style='text-indent:.5in;'>(e)  The commission may modify a quality-based payment system developed under this chapter to account for programmatic differences between the child health plan <u>program</u> and Medicaid [<s>programs</s>] and delivery systems under those programs.</p>
