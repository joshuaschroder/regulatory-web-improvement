<p>The Standardization of Food Safety Inspection Officers program promotes consistency in the interpretation of the Texas Food Establishment Rules (TFER). Local health jurisdictions may request that their training officer complete the standardization exercise with a state standardization officer, who has been certified by US Food and Drug Admninistration (FDA). </p>
<p>The training officer will demonstrate thorough knowledge and expertise in their understanding, application, and interpretation of the TFER, foodborne illness risk factors, public health interventions, and HACCP (Hazard Anaylsis and Critical Control Point) principles. They will also demonstrate the proper use of essential inspection equipment and the necessary communication skills to conduct a retail food establishment inspection. </p>
<p>After the successful completion of the standardization exercise, the training officer will be certified to train and standardize their food safety inspectors.</p>
