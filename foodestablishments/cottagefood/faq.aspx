In other words, a food must be held under proper temperature controls, such as refrigeration to prevent the growth of bacteria that may cause human illness. A PHF/TCS is a food that: contains protein, moisture (water activity greater than 0.85), and is neutral to slightly acidic (pH between 4.6 -7.5). </p>

<p id="11"><strong>Is labeling required on food items produced by a cottage food production operation? </strong>
<br/>Yes. Foods sold by a cottage food production operation must be packaged and labeled. The food must be packaged in a manner that prevents product contamination, except for foods that are too large and or bulky for conventional packaging. The labeling information for foods that are not packaged must be provided to the consumer on an invoice or receipt. The label must include the following information: </p>
<ul>
	<li>The name and address of the cottage food production operation; </li>

<p id="13"><strong>Is there a limit as to how much I can earn from my cottage food production operation? </strong>
<br/>Yes. A cottage food production operation is limited to an annual gross income of $50,000 or less from the sale of food produced at the cottage food production operation.</p>

<p id="14"><strong>Is there a process for submitting a complaint against a cottage food production operation? </strong>
<br/>Yes. A complaint may be submitted to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) for cottage food production operations located under DSHS jurisdiction at: <a title="/foodestablishments/complaints.aspx" href="/foodestablishments/complaints.aspx">http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/foodestablishments/complaints.aspx</a>. If the cottage food production operation is located under the jurisdiction of a local health authority, that complaint must be registered with the local health authority.</p>

<p id="15"><strong>Will the Department of State Health Services conduct inspections at cottage food production operations? </strong>
<br/>No. The Texas Department of State Health Services does not have authority to conduct inspections at a cottage food production operation. However, the Department may investigate a complaint regarding preparation of potentially hazardous food at a private residence.

<p id="18"><strong>Can a cottage food production operation deliver food produced by the operation to the customer who purchased the food product? </strong>

<p id="19"><strong>What are pickles? </strong>
<br/>Pickles are made from cucumbers that have been preserved in vinegar, brine, or a similar solution. Only pickled cucumbers are allowed under the Cottage Food Law. All other pickled vegetables are prohibited. Federal requirements have been established for production of acidified foods such as pickles. If foods are sold across state lines, then the federal requirements would definitely apply. Under the FDA’s interpretation of “interstate commerce,” the federal requirements might also apply to cottage food producers who purchase supplies from out-of-state. As a precautionary measure, you may wish to take the federal course if you intend to sell pickles under the cottage foods law.</p>
