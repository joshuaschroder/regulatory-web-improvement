<p>The Public Restrooms program has several components, one of which is to ensure that, in conjunction with the <a title="Texas State Board of Plumbing Examiners" href="http://www.tsbpe.state.tx.us/">Texas State Board of Plumbing Examiners</a>, sufficient restroom facilities, permanent or temporary, are provided where the public congregates. The second component is the requirement to provide access to restroom facilities for individuals with certain medical conditions that are confirmed with either an identification card or statement from licensed medical professional. The other components concern providing restroom facilities and maintaining sanitary restroom conditions in specific public facilities.</p>

<p>Facilities where the public congregates include stadiums, community and convention halls, event centers, and sports and entertainment arenas. The number of restroom at these facilities is prescribed by the Uniform Plumbing Code and the International Plumbing Code adopted by the Texas State Board of Plumbing Examiners.</p>

<p>Retail establishments are required to let individuals with identified medical conditions, which must be confirmed by either an identification card, or a letter from a doctor, registered nurse or physicianâ€™s assistant, use the restroom in that establishment.</p>

<p>DSHS will investigate public restroom facility complaints in areas of the State where there is no local health department or code enforcement officials. DSHS will refer complaints about public restroom facilities to municipalities or counties with a health department or code enforcement officials.</p>
