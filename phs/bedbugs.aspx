<p>Bed bugs are small, wingless insects that have <strong><em>not</em></strong> been known to transmit disease. Adult bed bugs have flat, oval shaped bodies. They are between 1 to 7 millimeters in length (about the size of an apple seed). The size of an adult bed bug varies, because their bodies become larger after a blood meal. After eating they change to a reddish color. Bed bugs are usually active at night and bite humans and animals while they are sleeping. <strong><em>They can live several months without feeding.</em></strong></p>

<h2>Where are Bed Bugs Found?</h2>
<p><a title="click to view larger image" href="http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/assets/0/76/110/8589934629/8589934646/79a252f1-2178-4b83-9b24-357c10769528.jpg"><img src="http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/assets/0/76/110/8589934629/8589934646/34e1654b-41e0-473d-a475-48e880584441.jpg" alt="another close up view of a bed bug"  title="another close up image of a bed bug" align="right" style="margin-left:15px;"></a>
Bed bugs can be found anywhere, such as houses, apartments, group living situations, hospitals, hotels/motels, and public transportation vehicles. These places have areas where people sleep or spend significant amounts of time. Their usual hiding places are in seams of mattresses, box springs, bed frames, and along and/or directly behind headboards. Once a bed bug population multiplies, they can be found: behind baseboards; in cracks and crevices in furniture, floors, or walls; under cluttered areas; and in electronic appliances. A bed bug infestation is apparent by noticing black or brown spots (which are their waste products) on surfaces. The eggs, egg shells, and exoskeletons of the bed bugs can be found in their hiding places as well. <br/><span class="small" style="float:right;">Click on picture for a larger view<br />Photo courtesy of Lois N Sorkin, BCE</span></p>

<a class="bookmark" title="How are Bed Bugs Transported?" name="transport"></a>
<h2>How are Bed Bugs Transported?</h2>
<p>Because bed bugs can be found in homes and a variety of public places, they can easily be transported from place to place by people. They can hide in the seams of luggage and in the folds of clothing. They can also be transported in furniture.</p>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" title="Can Bed Bugs Make You Sick?" name="sick"></a>
<h2>Can Bed Bugs Make You Sick?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs are <strong>not</strong> known to transmit disease, but many people have mild to severe allergic reactions to the bites. Bed bug bite marks usually appear on the face, neck, arms, hands, but can appear on other body parts. The marks are slightly swollen, red areas that can itch or be irritating.</p>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" title="How Can I Get Rid of Bed Bugs?" name="elimination"></a>
<h2>How Can I Get Rid of Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>It usually takes multiple visits by licensed pest control operator who has experience in elimination of bed bugs. Please seek the advice of a licensed pest control operator for treatment options. <strong><em>Over the counter foggers and pesticides will not eliminate bed bugs.</em></strong></p>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" title="Is There Effective Treatment for Bed Bug Bites?" name="treatment"></a>
<h2>Is There Effective Treatment for Bed Bug Bites?</h2>
<p>If you are experiencing bed bug bites and feel that you are having an allergic reaction, please contact your physician. Topical antihistamine or anti-inflammatory medication may provide relief.</p>

<h2>Bed Bugs and Schools and Daycares</h2>
<p>Bed bugs prefer an environment where they can hide during the day and come out at night to feed. Most schools or daycare settings do not offer this type of environment; however, bed bugs can hide in clothing and personal belongings such as backpacks and lunch bags. This provides them an opportunity to migrate and spread to other individuals.</p>
<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" title="Bed Bug Prevention" name="prevention"></a>
<h2>Bed Bug Prevention</h2>
<p>Schools are required to have a school Integrated Pest Management Program (IPM) in place that should address all forms of pests. Trained staff should be available to identify bed bugs in the classroom, on children’s items, and be able to identify bed bug bites on children. Please treat students respectfully and handle the situations discreetly. Information should be sent to students for their families and educational seminars should be held for the benefit of the school community.</p>

<p>In some cases bed bugs are unknowingly brought into hotels in luggage, clothing, blankets and pillows from hotel guests. Hotels with high turnover are especially vulnerable to infestation. No hotel is immune to a bed bug infestation.</p>
<p><strong>Several steps may be taken to reduce the incidence of bed bugs in a hotel:</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Have an inspection plan in place so staff can identify a bed bug infestation before guests arrive. </li>
	<li>Train staff to inspect rooms upon vacancy for signs of bed bugs and make a visual inspection for bed bugs part of the staff’s cleaning routine every time a room is vacated. </li>
	<li>If bed bugs are identified, remove all mattresses, box springs, and draperies from the room. </li>
	<li>Store infected mattresses and box springs in zippered plastic mattress covers isolated and offsite for one year to insure the elimination of the bed bugs. </li>
	<li>Wash all linens, draperies, and towels in hot water and dry at the highest heat setting for at least 20 minutes. </li>
	<li>Vacuum furniture; including areas behind paintings, dressers, desks, floors and carpeting with a heavy duty HEPA vacuum paying special attention to cracks and crevices along the seam line of the carpet, and baseboards. Remove vacuum bag immediately and discard in a sealed, airtight bag. Keep any vacuum utilized in bed bug removal isolated and wash all attachment in hot water. Before vacuuming place a knee high stocking over attachment handle to capture bed bugs, eggs, and nymphs. </li>
	<li>Repair cracks in plaster and loose wallpaper. Seal cracks around the baseboards with caulking material. </li>
	<li>Have the room treated by a licensed pest control operator and do not offer the room for occupation until it has be certified as bed bug free from a licensed pest control operator. </li>
</ol>
<p>Remember over the counter pesticides and foggers are NOT Effective treatments for bed bugs.</p>

<p>A good Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach should utilize all possible methods of prevention and treatment available that reduce the risk of pesticide exposure. Facilities should have an IPM plan in place to deal with bed bug issues before they become a problem. IPM methods include:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Inspect infected areas, and the surrounding units or living spaces.</li>
	<li>Train maintenance personnel on proper identification of bed bugs.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>Once bed bugs have been identified:</em></strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Remove all clutter from the infested area. </li>
	<li>Wash all clothing and items including curtains, area rugs, and personal effects in hot water and utilize the highest drier setting for drying (20 minutes minimum). Items not washable should be dry-cleaned. </li>
	<li>Place a knee high stocking over vacuum cleaner attachments to capture bed bugs, nymphs and eggs. Discard stocking in air tight plastic bag after use. </li>
	<li>Vacuum all cracks and crevices paying special attention to carpet seam lines along base boards. </li>
	<li>Vacuum all fixed furniture with a Heavy Duty HEPA vacuum, remove contents, place in air tight plastic bag, and discard immediately. The vacuum cleaner should be designated for use in bed bug removal only. Wash all attachments in hot water and store vacuum cleaner in an area separate from living facilities. </li>
	<li>Repair any damaged or peeling wall paper and seal all cracks and crevices. </li>
	<li>Contract a licensed pest control operator who has experience in the treatment and removal of bed bugs to treat the living space and the surrounding spaces to insure eradication. </li>
	<li>Encase all mattresses and box springs in plastic covers, remove them and store in location away from living units for at least one year. </li>
	<li>Do not allow residents to re-inhabit the area until the area has been certified as bed bug free. </li>
	<li>To prevent future infestations all sleeping mattresses and box springs should be encased in plastic mattress covers and only metal bed frames should be utilized.<strong><em> </em></strong></li>
