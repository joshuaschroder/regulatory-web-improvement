<p>The program includes inspections and complaint investigations of hotels, motels, campgrounds, inns, and RV parks. These establishments are inspected to ensure sanitary conditions are maintained and that any food service is operated in accordance with applicable sections of the <a title="Texas Food Establishment Rules" href="http://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.ViewTAC?tac_view=5&ti=25&pt=1&ch=229&sch=K&rl=Y">Texas Food Establishment Rules</a>.</p>

<p>DSHS will, as resources and time allow, inspect and investigate complaints about hotels, motels, inns, RV parks, and campgrounds in areas of the state where there is no local health department or code enforcement officials. DSHS will refer complaints about hotels, motels, inns, RV parks and campgrounds to municipalities or counties with a health department or code enforcement officials.</p>
