<p>The Toxicology program monitors, tracks and investigates (by conducting home assessments) elevated blood lead (EBL) levels in children under 15 years of age.</p>

<p>This program caters to all children under the age of 15, either diagnosed or undiagnosed, with lead toxicity/exposure. A provider can order blood tests to confirm contamination, if they suspect lead exposure. Parents can receive information if they suspect lead exposure or if they do not know where to go or how to handle the situation.</p>

<p>Information, forms and other resources may be found on the DSHS Texas <a title="Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program" href="http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/lead/">Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program</a> website as well as the <a title="Environmental Lead Program" href="/elp/">Environmental Lead Program</a> Web site.</p>

<p>The Toxicology program also answers questions from all consumers/public-at-large on health effects of any toxic or hazardous chemicals they might have been, or suspect they might have been, exposed to. You may contact Toxicology whether you are already experiencing symptoms, or just need information prior to exposure. Toxicology can also answer questions related to MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) and Rules, Regulations and Statutes protecting/covering chemical exposure.</p>

<p>For more information on either EBL or the health effects of any toxic or hazardous chemicals contact: Thandi Ziqubu-Page at (512) 834-6788 ext. 2803 or <a title="contact by email" href="mailto:PHSCPS@dshs.state.tx.us">contact by email</a>.</p>
