<p>The mission of the AHERA program is to protect students, their families, educators and staff from exposure to asbestos in schools. To prevent exposure to asbestos in school buildings, AHERA requires all public and non-profit schools inspect each school building for asbestos containing building material and prepare an asbestos management plan to prevent disturbance of asbestos. DSHS strives to carry out the AHERA mission efficiently, effectively, fairly and professionally with respect and dedication to all Texans.</p>

<h2>Applicability</h2>
<p>The federal Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) was implemented under the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA) through 40 CFR Part 763, Subpart E regulations to address asbestos hazards in building materials in schools. AHERA regulations affect all public and private non-profit schools offering kindergarten to 12th grade classes. Private for-profit schools are excluded from AHERA requirements.</p>
<p>Since 1989 the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) has participated in a collaborative agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to promote and assure compliance with AHERA requirements in Texas by conducting compliance inspections and investigating complaints of Texas public and private non-profit school facilities.</p>
